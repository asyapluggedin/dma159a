21:09:48 This is your capstone class.
21:09:45 Hello.
21:09:48 Hey, welcome back.
21:09:50 Thanks.
21:09:52 This is your capstone class with Chandler.
21:10:06 Subtitles setting chat. The show is in June. Yeah I'm kind of like.
21:10:11 So you made a discord but he's like
21:10:16 we had one discord got it does want and for some reason that person is like not involved in the capstone stuff at all which kind of like upsets me because like that guy was so good.
21:10:33 Um, and our discord is not too bad I can.
21:10:39 Okay.
21:10:39 It's like reading this,
21:10:47 see what this.
21:10:55 How many people are in this class.
21:10:59 billion.
21:11:01 How many more than 20.
21:11:06 Um, let's see how do you see him video.
21:11:14 Well okay so total in all of them in our whole year graduating is like, so there's three cups done courses, each with a different focus is that what this is.
21:11:23 Yeah, total we have like probably 16 people in mind, we have when we see how do you see how many people are in one channel. I don't think you can really.
21:11:39 How can you see who has what you see how many people have a certain role.
21:11:44 I also don't think you can, because I have this role, and I wonder how many of you can look at the members list. Maybe I can literally just count up 456-789-1011 1213 1415 1617 1819.
21:12:06 There's 20 of us.
21:12:07 Yeah, unless you're an admin in the discord I don't think you can see those lists, that makes sense it's probably 2222 because it's usually the.
21:12:14 Okay, on that customer this gaming gaming kind of interactivity section is that something that you chose.
21:12:21 I chose it because I want to work with Chandler because I didn't want to work with whoever's in here.
21:12:27 Julian, that I can't work with like I don't like working with her she's very tense and then I don't know Aaron Cooney.
21:12:35 And like I know Chandler is really cool so I was like fuck I don't know turn their super well but he seems cool and I met him before. He's very cool I mean you can already see you already have a relationship with them so that's good.
21:12:50 Yeah.
21:12:52 And what is it that you think that I can help with, um,
21:13:02 because so far like you've told me a little bit about your ideas and your, and the project like in passing, and I've only been just like supportive, you know like as a friend.
21:13:14 I haven't put on my, there was kind of one moment where I gave you a little bit, I kind of put on my critical hat, a little bit, but not even I just kind of gave you a reference for something, you know, to look at.
21:13:27 But like, I mean, yeah, I think if you could kind of tell me what it is that you need help with that might be good because I don't want to like just immediately put on my like
21:13:39 like deconstructionist like mode.
21:13:43 And like act like professor, well that's not really what I need right now like now like if you don't need it and if you're not ready for it but that is kind of my default, so just, if you could kind of help me know what.
21:13:56 So, where's the questions.
21:14:06 So my Victor right now he like set up the doc himself.
21:14:13 And like started the business his or his mind is like he's been like he owns a lot of these dogs and files which is not fair.
21:14:25 And he's just started doing this in here, which is also like it's my job, you don't get to just go and do someone else's job for them without.
21:14:33 We're looking at this, because it's in my tabs. Yeah, get rid of them. let's focus on the capstone stuff.
21:14:39 Well.
21:15:01 I sent you the website has the assignment and I was just going to show you that. I don't know why I'm looking looking for it and all my calves. Yep, I read, I read through the whole thing.
21:15:09 Okay, cool. Well then, I showed you.
21:15:14 I know I guess I'm not ready for this call, and they say I'm not ready for this class and get some just.
21:15:19 What do you want from me.
21:15:21 Well you had some you had some stuff in some notes, and also you've shared the idea with me before. So,
21:15:29 you know, do you just want to kind of loop me in on like. So, so far I you know I didn't know that this same prize project was one what you were picking for the class.
21:15:39 I also not taking anything we're just talking about two possible directions that can go and like I feel like I'm just gonna go okay cool so so save fries is one have multiple options that's new to me.
21:15:50 I didn't know that yet.
21:16:04 I'm going to read these notes of yours. Okay, then I'll ask you some questions.
21:16:27 Okay, so this is something that you're, you're a couple days behind on right.
21:16:32 These two different video about these two different directions. Is that where you're at right now.
21:16:40 Yes.
21:16:41 Okay.
21:16:44 Well, I know that can be frustrating but I wouldn't let it get to you. I'm sure it'll be fine.
21:16:50 I think the same price thing is, obviously, direction number one and it seems like you have direction number to kind of,
21:17:00 like, do you want to tell me what you're kind of thinking about that because that seems like it's a little bit, you're kind of just piecing it together right right now.
21:17:26 So before I started Brand New Zealand, like, a lot of my brain space was like, oh designers are kind of thing so like I had this, this is a really bad render but kind of an idea I had was like to do an ad campaign for Calvin Klein, that was also kind
21:17:44 of a non project.
21:17:52 Really bad joke over, like it's actually funny that like Camille's username is ck
21:17:59 Yeah.
21:18:13 Cuz I was, I think I had a username somewhere but that was ck none, because I was really obsessed with this idea and like I had a website for a while and I was like, I wanted to actually deface like lots of big billboards or like rent billboards and just
21:18:14 like put up illegal. You know copyright, trademark infringing
21:18:21 ads that would basically talk about this campaign of like, you know, we're branding nothing as like a weight, you know, a way to like move into the future whatever
21:18:33 is big business legible to read.
21:18:35 I read I just read it.
21:18:36 Yeah, well show me some other stuff to tell it helps for me to see stuff.
21:18:44 Okay, this was, this is really hard to tell what's going on but, yeah.
21:18:50 Okay. Okay, here, this is the same thing. So this was like, I'm also before school.
21:18:58 I was part of a some sort of like, weird show.
21:19:02 And I made this installation, where I designed all the labels
21:19:08 packaged goods and then I put this weird like coconut.
21:19:12 I can't wake up in graffiti. And then I made this collage on newsprint which like this is basically kind of like a meltdown center to go Photoshop collage that you printed on newsprint.
21:19:25 Um, yeah, yeah but the whole thing, the whole idea is kind of like a apocalypse like meltdown
21:19:33 simulation theory kind of concept.
21:19:36 Because all of the objects, then I'll show you actually this part where you can see it a little closer, the graphic design.
21:19:46 Actually this is really bad.
21:19:49 Yeah, I should have a better copy somewhere in this is this is a PSD literally open it up.
21:20:01 So these are the labels.
21:20:05 Yeah.
21:20:11 No, this tiny one so tiny.
21:20:17 One farewell. Okay. I don't know what some shady but okay I can still make, I can still make up the content, even if it's basically like these are like, this is designed to make you feel like you're going crazy.
21:20:44 You're dreaming wake up, I mean I told you like help me I'm settled second this bottle of milk product SOS smiley paragraph type tech say, some of them got to stress notion that a natural glow oh this is like me talking about this part is like basically
21:20:53 talking about how facial hair highlighter is a, like a, it's a good, it's a guys so complicated.
21:21:09 I'm late reflecting topical antidepressant and preposterous notion that a natural glow is empowering alternative to chiseled not contouring highlight is as much of an overpriced commodity fetish incompatible with the new face just like a big contrast
21:21:23 he woke.
21:21:25 Wake up, none of this is real. Your something yourself simulacra and simulation theory, I can't read that that's way too small. Okay.
21:21:35 But the show is called strobe, so like this was, this basically was a jar of highlighter.
21:21:42 So I like, I wrote this whole essay actually that I just like to kind of drill down into this label, about how.
21:21:49 In the past we have like lipstick.
21:22:08 And finally, the lipstick effect in economics are like you'd have like no money and then you buy something small and like how that related to this idea of beauty and empowerment and what like empowerment as even means and like why we moved away from a
21:22:04 certain type of like drag makeup in the 80s to a certain kind of like glossy finish in the 90s and how we're seeing that again was like very chiseled contoured like production makeup in the 2000s and then like into the.
21:22:25 You were kind of analyzing makeup as a, as a technology. I'm connecting some other ideas to the form of that, like poetically. Yeah. Nail bottle I forget what this one's about at all.
21:22:34 And it's hard to see.
21:22:37 And when you say, I'm in this project when you say this is UI This is UX What do you mean by that you're relating the makeup technology to those concepts right.
21:22:48 I'm in like the whole, the overarching.
21:22:58 It's an interactive piece so you're kind of trying to say that to that you designed this thing as an interactive thing. The overarching idea is that you're picking up these products thinking that you're looking at makeup or that you're like looking at,
21:23:03 you know, maybe like weird embedded essays, like, you know, theory stuff about makeup, but like the more you read the more you realize that like, actually it's not about the labels you're reading aren't like about theory or about makeup they're actually
21:23:16 telling you that you're in a simulation.
21:23:21 And nothing is real and that like you're, you need to get out of it and that like you're part of the computer system too. So it's just like really it I mean it's tackling goofy but like I felt like the gods, one of the reasons that I, you want to.
21:23:35 You wanted to have the viewer, the complicated as a character is what you're saying.
21:23:42 Yeah, yeah. And like this is UXSZY it's like this whole thing is an interface. Right, get out kind of thing. Like, like why would you theorize about makeup like to, you know, was it that you put the phone there because that's like a reminder of the fact
21:24:02 fact that you interact with that thing.
21:24:08 On
21:24:08 the other stuff to it saying this is just based on it.
21:24:12 That was a selfie illuminating case.
21:24:16 Unlike when you pick up the phone, it was like, I would often come back and like put it on selfie mode. So if you picked it up you see your face. Gotcha.
21:24:24 That's actually like a thing that I really like to do, I was, this was made before you actually entered. Yeah, yeah.
21:24:32 Okay, this is like completely like outsider like art like this is me making art and not thinking about like, like, not knowing anything about the art world not knowing anything about design, not knowing anything about media or just like I went to like
21:24:45 a bunch of galleries in LA and I looked at stuff and I didn't understand it, I did cope with some people, and then I was like, I'm going to make art to and this is what I made.
21:24:53 How did you scan in those, those things on the right at home or something. Yeah, with the thing, a forced me. And then what was this opportunity. It was like a group show somewhere that you might do you know Nick's you.
21:25:11 He was interviewed by Lauren rhizome I think he's like he graduated from weed, I think. During like computer science but also doing art and then he moved to LA and, like, started throwing worked at Mobile mocha as an artist is that, and then like started
21:25:33 like warehouse parties with his friend Matt del. And sometimes was like, you know, felt like one of the warehouses like sometimes it'd be our show. So we're just like this one spot in LA where like, it was just an open spot and you could do.
21:25:44 You could take some space and do something with it and were you asked to do this.
21:25:49 some space and do something with it and were you asked to do this. So he was, he asked me to do it he really was like he was driving.
21:25:53 Okay. They were like hey I'm doing this thing you should do something for it and then he did it, and he did this.
21:26:00 Great.
21:26:02 This was a.
21:26:04 There's a gift somewhere, but this was like a processing game that I made the ends and also selfie mode.
21:26:20 I'm deeper into this like this direction but yeah you saw it right.
21:26:19 Yeah, um, what else relates okay this kind of relates to this thing where basically like this is spec. So this isn't real. But what okay so what was real.
21:26:29 This is really complicated but basically, we're looking at this is a slide from something where you're explaining something, I guess. Yeah, because at the time I didn't know how to achieve this like show something self explanatory so I have to explain,
21:26:41 but this slide is about how I invited a bunch of people, friends and friends of friends to go into different grocery stores with me.
21:26:51 And then I would walk through the grocery store in a very like specific way with them and make them all swap credit cards, if they wanted to buy anything and just tell them that they had to buy like similar dollar amount so they wouldn't advocate to the
21:27:03 to the back so like everyone if you're trying to grocery shop here, because you're here, you know, you're all going to spend like 50 bucks. Just for credit cards in your shop.
21:27:12 And then they were like why, and then that was kind of like, it was like, oh, we're going to talk about like surveillance in grocery stores and how it works.
21:27:20 So like we walk around and be like this was designed, like this so you would do this, you know, why are you looking at that like look at how like this person from maybe a different demographic is walking around the grocery store like think about this.
21:27:32 And then you wanted. You wanted the audience of the lecture to be aware of their position as the user in that space that was designed, right. Yes. And then also one thing that like I did was, sometimes I go into the store and I make little labels, Or
21:27:42 like i'd right like on pieces of paper like the supermarket doesn't love you or like you're being watched, or whatever, and like put it stuff and I had, I really wanted to do this and see the connections now.
21:28:01 But what I wanted to do is to like basically redesign consumer packaged goods to also reference this project.
21:28:09 And like, maybe like you make it whatever like a milk carton but instead of it saying, or like a juice thing instead of saying proper candidates is like, you know, the website where you can access like my woke take.
21:28:24 And then people that come tend to like wait a minute, this is the goal of this says like, you know, store is evil.com but it looks like just follow what's going on, like, just like fucking with the, what is feels normal outside.
21:28:43 This type of stuff.
21:28:44 Yes, definitely.
21:28:52 But but trying but trying to to move beyond that, too. Yeah. Yeah, come through a complex interactive system right.
21:28:58 That's pretty clear.
21:29:01 It's not really just it's never just about those labels or those images that's like a fun thing you do inside of these projects that are bigger, but that is something that you like to do, you do like to make images like that, you know,
21:29:16 which are kind of masquerades right the images that pretend that there's something that they're not that usually they're trying to tell the truth, somehow.
21:29:25 So there's already like a pretty strong. Can you show me some more stuff.
21:29:31 I'm probably not like late into that I can show you like random stuff but more important works, funny I painted all the beer cans, wait.
21:29:56 At this show that I created which was when I like showed that film that I made.
21:29:52 So the film was actually shot here.
21:29:56 Right. We're all these kids are standing. And then it was also projected into the same space.
21:30:03 And actually showed this. You never told me that this film was shown and, yeah, that was.
21:30:12 I did this whole, where is it, so there wasn't a show but I assumed it was like in a space that was different and then it was on TV or something he never talks about the space that it was in.
21:30:22 And what and really quickly.
21:30:26 Asia where's the show going to be your Capstone show is it going to be physically installed somewhere. We don't know like that's also, you know, when we're putting out.
21:30:36 Usually it would be, usually, but but right now it's unclear what the output is right.
21:30:42 Okay.
21:30:45 I don't know why I don't have everything here this is really annoying.
21:30:49 I'm sorry.
21:30:56 on hard drives. Yeah, it's okay it's just nice for me to see some other examples of things that you're like proud of. So I get a sense for why you're getting the ideas that you're getting now and where they're coming from.
21:31:05 Yeah.
21:31:08 I mean you saw this, you know about this.
21:31:16 Was there anything. Is there anything that asked you ask you tarot deck that similar have this tendency to kind of like turn the image that's like lying in turn more truthful image, or is it all kind of tongue in cheek.
21:31:34 I'm
21:31:39 like, What do you say in this. Yeah What's this, this whole theory.
21:31:44 Got to be a new magic about the modern world. It's always sitting in the undiscovered on culture evolves. But since the internet operates on algorithms too many secrets with passively their cards on the table for this kind of okay this idea that like,
21:31:57 you know, maybe you are making a friend on the internet because an algorithm was like specifically designed to like move you together but sometimes that's not how it's like sometimes you're on Craigslist and like you see an ad for a house and it's really
21:32:11 beautiful then you go there and you're like, you know, your best friends like XM like it's your new friend or whatever, and like it just kind of happens magically, the internet is literally like a beautiful like crazy fucking Rolodex of numbers and shit
21:32:28 like it's like, Taro on steroids. It's like a, you know, like a Weegee board that's just been like programmed into every breathing robot and it's always been guided by users, all the time that are always online.
21:32:48 So yeah, so ask you, Taro is a technological step back. Instead of putting Taro into a game on a screen. I'm putting the screen into the taro and attempt to spiritually step forward by downgrading not only the shuffling, but also symbolic representation
21:33:01 perhaps we finally look back inside of ourselves. So yeah, it's like this.
21:33:14 Yeah, the downgrading to create our mind hardware Yeah, yep. Same, same basic idea, trying to get, get out the week it's the wake up call idea right.
21:33:19 I mean not too much I feel like this one's actually more related to something like this kind of sentiment that draws me towards whistle graph and, you know, Jeffrey right right no no no yeah but I'm, for sure.
21:33:31 That's part of what the part of what all art kind of does right when it's good, but the kind of tune in turn on drop out aspect runs through a lot of your projects.
21:33:43 So I'm just kind of, I'm just noticing that, you know, I'm not criticizing I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just saying like, Oh, this one, two, it also is about breaking out of the thing that is also about, and then in that case about turning inward.
21:33:55 Right. Yeah.
21:33:58 Anyway, I could do like a piece of shipping and just make hoodies and say coronavirus nine donkey, with a little like vaccination card slot.
21:34:11 I would be like really look at look look at this like mouthwash concept I did.
21:34:16 This is my like how do I do this is this is my like brilliant CPG at you. What if we made mouthwash, but make it luxury skincare.
21:34:27 Yeah, even though it's a wake up call.
21:34:31 Cute.
21:34:32 Like What Did you love this though, anyway yeah this is just like kind of something for product.
21:34:40 Yeah.
21:34:42 And again, this is all mental illness
21:34:46 illness.
21:34:49 Yeah, we can, because that means it's like, literally, my mental illness
21:34:57 is like a gift, like, This is like me but with like plastic surgery that it didn't Photoshop.
21:35:04 Interesting.
21:35:07 I wouldn't really call it that, but yeah.
21:35:20 And then okay I put this little number three in here too. I was thinking of you know that.
21:35:18 What's his name was Mark haurwitz painting, that's like, it looks like a Photoshop selector bar, but it's all like, no, blue and red and like kind of minimal looking.
21:35:30 I haven't seen that painting.
21:35:32 Okay, but I just described it so, yeah, I saw the Simcoe ranch or whatever and I like it really kind of stuck with me for a while and then I was like I really want to rip that off like that's really cute.
21:35:45 In this like kind of like corny post internet art way.
21:35:50 And then I thought like, Oh, well, what like I don't want to rip off like a Photoshop were like, you know, and this paint toolbar, that's like way to know, like a little too on the nose, like writer obscene.
21:36:04 And I was like, oh, what I would like to do is to make basically a memento memento mores so like take anything that represents death, or time passing in any way, and figure out a way to like abstract it, but still keep it recognizable.
21:36:21 Yeah, and they doing like a DEF CON rating system but instead of making it look really scary I'm like a nuclear war is about to happen, it would, you know you just put it in the background or your house and more people will be like, Oh cute What is that
21:36:34 like oh, you know, a reminder the nuclear war could happen any moment. Yeah. So, yeah, death is a big part of all your pieces by the way for me. Hmm, right, this the the whole idea of kind of trying to get out of simulation or trying to, you know, kind
21:36:53 of look inward or or break out of something like the idea of bringing people into the grocery store to tell them that their cattle, basically, all of that work points back to a history of artwork that it's kind of about death or the end, you know, you're
21:37:11 coding and technology, but that like, fundamentally, that it, a lot of it points to that so it's not surprising that you would be having this idea or thinking about that, that unrelated to your other work you know it's not surprising you would just go
21:37:27 directly to death as a, as a subject, because death is the escape right it's the ultimate wake up call it all is about, you know, how do you break out how do you hack out of the simulation you die.
21:37:39 Right.
21:37:41 So there's a pretty strong connection there and that links you to a big theme that I think you haven't really been probably putting forward in a lot of this stuff but at least that hooks you into a much larger.
21:37:55 I don't know.
21:37:56 History of like death based.
21:38:02 So it's like, yeah, you're kind of creating these like contemporary
21:38:08 contemporary descriptions of what death would look like, you know, certain kinds of death, you know capitalist death product death mouthwash death, you know.
21:38:21 Well, sure, or like metamorphosis.
21:38:24 Yeah, yeah well yeah same thing. I mean that's what work. That's what death is about right. It's always about. That's what death is as a subject that's what makes it so rich right it's always also life, you know, It's about the traits about the transition
21:38:37 from one state to another state, and the accessibility of travel between those two states, you know, and how difficult it is to move between them.
21:38:49 It was like now they've seen this they're holding this.
21:38:53 Yeah, I see that it's literally be Latin. It's only Latin.
21:39:00 Nice, went to
21:39:05 India for a minute class about metamorphoses and its references and responses and culture. Right now,
21:39:18 I think, I think when it comes to your, how is it that you came to these ideas that you have so far like can you kind of tell me a little bit of the story of how the Save fries thing became a thing.
21:39:29 Okay, because because obviously stuff was happening in the world, and then you know stuff and now all of a sudden there's a domain name right order and stuff so can you kind of walk me through what that was like, I guess like okay, I'll start with really
21:39:44 really really far away, and it's going to be like, I wasn't in school, I wasn't, you know I was like so doing jobs in LA. I just found Landon who does like projection mapping was doing projection mapping clubs, and I was working with them as apprentice.
21:40:07 And we would build computers together to do like to create these like super computers for production mapping because you have to build some crazy rig.
21:40:18 And often we go to frys together, and pick out parts and like sometimes I go alone.
21:40:24 And I, I had never really experienced something just like for us to me it was really beautiful thing Americana but also every single thing that I needed, and you know this was I don't actually know what the contents of prizes.
21:40:36 Is it like is it like
21:40:40 what makes it different from a Best Buy or to say, Oh my god, so you tell me real quick.
21:40:51 Um,
21:40:51 so yeah. The reason I'm so emotional is because it's like when you, when you go to first, first of all, like usually the outside exterior it like in Burbank there's a literal UFO.
21:41:02 I saw the photo of that crazy and then you walk inside, and like, there's little like mascots and like just a fucking they have a chip, a literal chip as their mascot.
21:41:15 Right.
21:41:15 Like people where the chip costume doing great you sometimes, then there's like bubble, bubble gum machines in the front which doesn't it's not very appropriate, because it has like like old timey and very kind of diner vibe, it was kind of kind of Chucky
21:41:29 cheese a fight as a retail experience. It was supposed to be the one stop shop for the Silicon Valley professional, you know, you go in and you get your milk shake and get your computer parts and then you're going skate in the background and then like
21:41:42 the bourbon one had a movie theater.
21:41:46 It was like this vision, this vision of a it's, I understand completely, it's the vision of the electronic store that furniture store is actually still have where they have like a movie theater and they're like this big place and it's kind of Disney FIDE,
21:42:00 and it might be kind of linear.
21:42:03 It's like, it's like it's like Disneyland ish. Yeah, yeah I got I got the vibe, but also at the same time it probably operates like for example there's this one store and Finland Virgo copper, which Finland doesn't have Amazon, but they have Virgo copper
21:42:22 which is a giant building in which you can buy all the stuff, all the adapters, all the Monster Energy drinks, all the, you don't mean, it's kind of like my guess is it's a little bit closely related in terms of just having the same content to buy.
21:42:36 But fries sounds like it's a branding experience that was really influential on you.
21:42:42 Yeah, it's mostly the it's mostly the packaging and branding and the fantasy that it.
21:42:50 It sounds to me like the reason why you're interested in it is because that fantasy, like you know when I went through today, is it
21:42:59 up in all the corners, it has it's like the library of Oxnard actually gave them these big prints of like Ochsner an agricultural history. Like, they're like museums, each one is like this whole experience in.
21:43:14 And, yeah, it was also my first experience of learning how to work with hardware and like make things and feel useful.
21:43:22 You know, it was like it was associated with this job that I had with a friend. I'm still friends with were like, like all my friends are so impressed with me that like I could take apart my computer like an ak 47 and put it back together and it would
21:43:36 function, like I could fix anything anyone who had problems with their iPhones or Mac bugs they'd be like I said can you help me I'd be like, sure, you know, because like I can find anything on the internet and my new all the rules to how to not, not,
21:43:48 you know, you know have anything like short circuiting burn up or whatever.
21:43:53 And I was always really professional but like I'd make sure that to have like static touchpad and everything and like whatever and I loved that they're not and I love like the maker movement and I love all this stuff.
21:44:06 Yeah, and my little brother.
21:44:14 And he was like I can get anything I need there I looked at their website it's wack, and I was like no no you have to go. And when we showed up I saw this thing just dying.
21:44:23 And then, and it was really challenging actually to get my brother in there like I had to control my parents into getting my brother here.
21:44:33 I, you know, then it was challenging even get us to the store and like we enter the room, as an afterthought thought favorite me, not even like worrying about buying the product so I just gave him an Amazon gift card ultimately for like 500 bucks and
21:44:47 shit. And then two weeks later if I know that the store is closed and like he guided me because it was, I'll show you this thing that I made for me the other.
21:44:57 It says fries, calm everywhere in the store right.
21:45:00 Yes, fries or it has like this huge alien or like some.
21:45:08 Your wherever it's crazy. Here's what I think.
21:45:13 This is why I think it's probably meaningful for you.
21:45:17 think that fries presented Silicon Valley and technology in like an optimistic way that you actually believed in kind of like a web one point O even pre web one point O kind of Radio Shack kind of way, which is extremely different from the branding that
21:45:33 you see in neoliberalism and like Software as a Service world, which is usually a branding of unrepaired ability and of service.
21:45:41 And so there's a kind of a DIY quality to the branding but also a kind of friendly optimism like Microsoft Clippy, you know, coming out of that world that's left over, and you're and you're watching this world die.
21:45:53 And you wish that that was the world that took over but it wasn't, it was a different world it's a world of iPhone apps basically that you can't repair and have devices that you have to send back to the factory.
21:46:02 Right. And so, even in your story about your brother, having this difficulty, you know, building the computer, whatever, it's also witnessing the death of that thing and also this is another project about death.
21:46:16 Yeah.
21:46:19 You know, you're dealing with the death of a culture that you wish. Silicon Valley kind of was, but that culture can exist. It's squashed out, you know, I mean it comes in was like really also deep frustration that I just feel like a mass of humanity.
21:46:39 All just gave up.
21:46:44 Like, it's great. I feel like it's connected to like me, being excited about being Russian, and living in the states and like, how about sweetheart and stuff I'm just like, Oh yeah, what's that connection right there.
21:46:58 I mean, you literally started it like dealing with the death of a culture that I wish existed today but it can't exist, we got squashed out a do you relate that to your own nationalism.
21:47:10 Absolutely, I mean like that sentence can be is if you just said that sentence and apply to me that's, that's kind of your whole carcass in a nutshell.
21:47:19 In the last like the last decade of your practice probably, You know, that's what all this work is about.
21:47:27 I mean, it's like, and it's also trying to desperately find a place in the new culture and figuring out where you fit in, I mean there's all these things that you love to do.
21:47:37 Right. You love to make labels you love to make screen things enough to make images you love to make interactive performances you love to make videos you have to write theory, you have to think about things and have ideas, but the culture that you're
21:47:52 participating in is the big crisis, because it's like, oh, do I join you know this, are these people or are they doing the right thing or not or is the whole thing going in the right way or not or it's like this, this thing is dead now.
21:48:06 I wish it wasn't because I would join that, you know, maybe I can make it happen again.
21:48:13 That's what that's the that's the tension in your practice.
21:48:20 You sound like, you know, have all this. All this ideas and problems and inspiration and work all stem from this really kind of basic like, oh, like, I'm India's forest for exile.
21:48:34 Not basic.
21:48:37 Let me show you this.
21:48:38 It's also not simple. Just because something is just because something is core doesn't mean it's it's reducible like that.
21:48:49 I'm your shopping a little bit I just had to say something.
21:48:52 What's up man. Oh, I wanted to say was like you know it's too emotional and it's too connected to you but like what you're saying like the dacha project right like cat like we talked about your Russian identity and how like you're sort of disappointed
21:49:21 what could have been or what isn't there whatever and you have this whole project that like is just in this weird limbo. It's like your dad's taken over you can't talk about it you can't pass it right. And that like giant Instagram thing you did the other night.
21:49:25 I don't know if you saw Jeffrey bulk all about your Russian identity.
21:49:30 And like, you know, I don't know, I just think it's really interesting. That's all. I'm not saying like, turn your Capstone into dacha.
21:49:44 You know that it's probably impossible it, but like, the amount of incredible effort and
21:49:46 so much of your identity that was baked into that project that's like, kind of the same thing. Right.
21:49:54 Well, you know, if you're an artist.
21:49:58 One of the hardest things, the realizations that you have to have usually for like the artist personality type is that no matter what you do, it's all going to be about the same thing for your whole life.
21:50:09 Yeah. And you know what, and it's just a matter of, including certain things in your, what you say as your artwork or not, but dealing with, but you're going to have to deal with the same stuff in and out of your art, no matter what and I don't know what
21:50:25 it is about artists, but they all know, me included, have had these moments where they're like Yep, that's like what I am.
21:50:35 You know, that's who I am. And it's part of its part of growing up as an artist and understanding where you're at. Think it's not easy though it's a struggle.
21:50:48 You know I struggled with it. I yeah I still struggle with it every day, but that's kind of the point of artists talking to artists I guess I just, it just like I can, you guys are talking about this and like the fact that wasn't.
21:50:59 No one said, or whatever I was just like, oh my god it's the elephant in the living room.
21:51:05 Okay, the transcript doesn't even put dacha does there.
21:51:10 Yeah, cuz I really see that yeah but yeah I don't know I guess I'll, I'll back out but it's a great conversation and it's cool that you brought it up.
21:51:21 I mean, you know, stage or maybe it's a soft point right now or it's something that you don't really want to bring into this whole UCLA world.
21:51:29 And that's totally fine but also like, I don't want to bring in any, like, oh, non English culture ship because that is so passe and like, like 60% of everyone's doing a capstone project is like here's, like, Here's a photo album of like my grandma from
21:51:44 Tibet, or whatever or like, here's like me being, you know, a third culture kid and I'm just like, ah,
21:52:08 family and you're like other identity when you're also you're also.
21:52:00 You're also sharing your paths.
21:52:01 Yeah, you're also in a difficult time for making art about that stuff, and you know that, where it's, it's kind of, you can easily be pigeonholed for the wrong thing, you know if your work.
21:52:11 You know you, you might have a project that might include some of that, but then it's not really about that but then everyone turns it about that. And then also you just see what everyone else is doing in class and in school and you see what all your
21:52:24 peers are doing and of course, there's a natural desire that you have to do it different, and to avoid cliches that everyone else might be.
21:52:34 We don't have, like, I don't, I don't, I have to do things in dialogue with people because I don't know if it's ADHD or if it's something else like that it's very difficult for me to spend time with myself on myself.
21:52:48 I like me talking to you it's just, I would have just watched TV, you know, I would have like absorbed my big and like someone else's thing out of some sort of avoidance or whatever I really need to like get like someone else needs to open me up and kind
21:53:06 of start playing the game and not like I can't play my own game. I don't know why I have some weird problem, but because of that, I can't really explore this whole Russian thing because I don't have a sub me.
21:53:20 I don't have a person who can do that. Um, it was my Instagram story that Ben was talking about, okay yeah I've been off it so I haven't seen but thanks for sending it was definitely like this is your whole life right like and now that I think about it.
21:53:34 It's just like nutrients right you've always been like put these ideas into like a business or into another concept like putting all this energy in the clubhouse and creating this really incredible thing right.
21:53:47 And it's like, it's a business or it's like a project that's not like proper art product it's not like to be exhibited in a gallery right it's like a real thing that people are interacting with it's almost not even well yeah i mean i do want more things
21:54:02 to be real things like what's cool about our is that like it's, you know, modifiable and you can be really deep and also really dumb and like it's so valuable, I just never thought of our projects are really but yeah like I want I don't want to like a
21:54:22 when I'm being creative. And it's not because I want to like create an art object or like explore a concept in the confines of an object or in confinement the gallery or someone's collection or whatever.
21:54:32 Like, I don't want to be like a page, it's turning my thoughts q that's inspiring. I want to literally like eat people. Yeah, like all the blend yeah that's just so interactive it's like a whole community I mean it.
21:54:46 What an interesting story and anyways, I just, I don't know, I don't have anything else to continue it just really like my boy sitting in the other room and everything like that.
21:55:04 Cool. Yeah, this is what I do every day in class so it's just, you know, for me it's just another day. Yeah.
21:55:04 But, well I don't have a lot of our friends. Why are you know artists and my life and so like that's not something I engage with like I don't think about people artists like you said like that's normal for an artist mindset, like that's not how I perceive
21:55:18 the world so it's like hard for me to see that hear that and be like, oh my god it's like mind blowing. Like I'm like oh, this would see the connection I don't know it's really different.
21:55:27 So, anyway, I'll give you guys more space in this conversation but thanks for letting me talk. Oh yeah, no problem. I mean it's cool you're listening,
21:55:38 probably still be like listening, neither. I'll try to not
21:55:45 do you see that way so yeah I see that.
21:55:49 But what um so yeah you did kind of talk about the.
21:55:57 Yeah. What about the, the dacha thing just just, we can just talk about it for like, 10 seconds, but it sounds, it sounds to me like, you know, it's,
21:56:11 it's kind of loaded for a number of reasons. So, and you see this as an opportunity to do something totally new. Right.
21:56:18 So that's what that's one of the reasons that we'll just, just like the idea that you wouldn't treat that as a work of yours, or as an accomplishment right now because it's a little touchy.
21:56:33 It's a little too fresh, you don't really understand it quite yet. There's not a full picture of it yet. Is that a little touchy about nutrients and that happened like what two years ago yeah what's touchy about that.
21:56:48 I mean I don't know I it's not that much going to so I kind of want to understand what was it like at the end of that and how do you look look back on it.
21:56:58 Not that it's ended either you know maybe it comes back, some way but I kind of want the post TMS on that and then we can look at this weird awesome boarding pass that you made
21:57:13 that boarding passes so funny.
21:57:35 Hmm.
21:57:35 So, I mean nutrients.
21:57:38 I was in Russian.
21:57:42 And this was like, after a period of.
21:57:50 I broke up with Asher in the winter and then I like kind of struggled in my winter quarter I was homeless in March and my birthday and then I moved into this place in like the grad student housing, which was illegal and like I run into airfield all the
21:58:03 time it would be funny.
21:58:05 And I really I don't know like I was said at the beginning and then towards the end of the quarter I started getting better and I flew to Amsterdam that teaches a ir class which I didn't know how to do until like the night before, or just taught myself
21:58:18 how to do it and then, because I didn't know anything and I started here and taught myself I was actually really good at teaching other people that were totally inexperienced.
21:58:27 Um, and did a great job and I felt really swag and cool and sexy, but not sexy enough because I didn't have my own thing, I wasn't like defined as a designer or an artist and like, wait, wait, wait, can you wind it back just a little bit, because I'm
21:58:44 trying to understand what this opportunity was for you to teach this class or whatever, and how that I got an email from Brenda UCLA where she was just like, emails, opportunities like all the time there was one that I like do the hackers and designers
21:59:01 Summer Academy Sandberg and scissors, and I was like what the hell like, oh, like, put in an application that like I'll teach them how to make like fake up each other and it's been like the workshop is going to have like this.
21:59:14 Cool.
21:59:14 Like fury flavor of like fake news and trauma or whatever, right, and I got in, I didn't expect that I would have just sent an application and kind of as a joke and I got it and they really liked it and I was like okay, I'll buy a ticket to Amsterdam
21:59:28 like all my supplies are paid for this is great.
21:59:32 And I combined that trip with a trip to Russia and I spent most of my summer in Russia, but a week in the Netherlands.
21:59:42 Yeah, yeah.
21:59:43 I know this, I know that those people yeah I don't know at the time I had you did this thing, you kind of, you kind of snuck yourself into this opportunity.
21:59:50 It was really cool. You felt something like you didn't have anything to call yourself and that was a weird, right there I was like that that I want to focus on.
22:00:00 I was, I wasn't actually to unsecured there.
22:00:05 I was like, comfortable being a younger person and like a design student and, you know, in process.
22:00:14 I felt actually like pretty confident as just a standalone person because a lot of the that summer was a lot of people are talking about Russia, and there is actually one of the women from the St Petersburg troll factory was giving a talk with the Sandberg
22:00:34 Institute, and like I met.
22:00:37 Daniel for meta haven we talked about quite a lot so like I had a lot of credit as is like Russian American person, so I didn't really feel like I had to make up for something or whatever, right fit in socially and that was easy.
22:00:52 Yeah, that was cool, but it was like, more, more so in more so in relation to like New York people and like kind of holy art crowd in LA and New York and people that are connected to like Asher, and maybe even Fiona and stuff like I always, always felt
22:01:25 like I wasn't enough that I didn't have like right and that's a big part of that is because those people don't usually give a fuck about technology or design, very much, or me or, or you or your specific euro, or other people I know.
22:01:27 Yeah, well it's a different, it's certain crowd it's an art it's a New York, LA, art, click crowd that is specific and it's very American.
22:01:36 But yeah like going up and having some sort of like credibility. Yeah.
22:02:02 I'm just to feel a little more confident and it is new to the point where I didn't even feel like I belonged in any spaces, because I didn't have it like at the, at the time I wasn't framing it as like, Oh yeah, I need this so these people like me or
22:01:56 accept me it was like completely internalize it was like, I'm not an artist I'm not worthy I'm not like my education.
22:02:09 of like get where I'm from a little bit, and they like, and I'm doing mentioning that for you but but but yeah but even in that, in that, but that sounds like that was a good social experience for you.
22:02:27 But, but, yeah, but even in that, in that, but that sounds like that was a good social experience for you. But even in that you're like, oh, but what's my stick like I don't have one.
22:02:31 Is that kind of accurate or you're really pushing in that direction but it's not really like that. Okay. Yeah, tell me what it's, it wasn't like that they're specifically.
22:02:43 There, I felt like I had a shtick, which was like this thing that I don't have right now that I did kind of abandoned in 2019, which was like, I wanted to develop some sort of like pedagogical art practice where I combine art and tech together and, like,
22:03:05 you know, research and teaching and like that's what I do as an artist, and like I could just sublimate all of my like desire for artists type credibility into my passion for technology and education and performing and leading, but like not leading a
22:03:21 fucking company just leading like five people in a room that are trying to figure out how to code something, or whatever, because I wasn't really good at that class, or they didn't class.
22:03:30 Right. Yeah. And then you had and then you, and then you kind of went.
22:03:34 Wait when when was that point of trying to win was that realization to sort of pedagogical art practice thing, this is, this is summer 2018.
22:03:45 Okay. And how did that kind of why did that happen.
22:03:52 When did you figure that's kind of what you're doing right you worked at that place you did work, you know you didn't hackers and designers I don't think I really thought about teaching in a very serious way before.
22:04:06 I mean obviously like I've always been tutoring and stuff and like I've been good at explaining things, so I was really good at putting together reading channels for all my classes at UCLA, other kids would come to me for resources and support, because
22:04:19 like, it's like I always like I was failing glasses, but I was good at, like classes, too. I was really good at them but then I was bad at doing the work, or bad at doing my work, I would do other people's work but I wouldn't do it for myself.
22:04:33 So it would be a great teacher.
22:04:38 Because I was always really happy to help others with what they're doing really good in this sort of collaborative kind of thing where I just do it. And then I don't get credit for love, really good.
22:04:49 And then I don't get credit for it. Love, really good. Awesome. Love that love that for me.
22:04:53 Um, but yeah so in Russia was when the nutrients idea was born and I can, like, actually focus on that. If you want to talk about nutrients, but to just finish off the whole pedagogical art practice.
22:05:08 But I then when I got back to the US, I decided to enroll in the classes because I did talk to a kid.
22:05:18 Before hackers and designers told me about it so I was like fuck all this sounds pretty good and I can, I can like meet some requirements there, and I got a job at you code, both like the you could thing kind of happened by accident, it was just like
22:05:36 I saw a job posting I was like this works really well and I need a job. And then I just really loved it.
22:05:38 And I stuck with it and I stuck with it like when CEO change, and then like loved it because it kind of aligned with some of those interests right and he gave me out of it when I realized I was contributing work that was like, you know, I was contributing
22:05:53 UX work, and it wasn't like, no big game of fog really, and then like the sea or try to put me into this like product for like VR education and just dumb shit.
22:06:05 And I was like, and I like just, you know, I just disappeared. I was also really stressed with money and other things but like I didn't, you know, I would have probably been happier if I had just started teaching kids how to do HTML, because that was
22:06:32 rewarding like the kids were rewarding. You know the other guy didn't get me but the kids I get the kids and the kids got me.
22:06:32 And what was so rewarding about that.
22:06:37 Um, well I guess the first thing was that I knew that I could help the kids in a very unique way, in a way that no other instructor was caring about them.
22:06:46 You are also designer.
22:06:50 You were designing all these novel things that were kind of yours that you were trying out on them right yeah yeah absolutely like I was working
22:06:59 the feedback loop. Like, I would talk to the CEO Sometimes you'd be like we're going to do this pipeline where we're going to like test out this little InDesign like this new curriculum and I, and I was just like yeah like I literally did that yesterday,
22:07:10 like design thinking whatever I literally did that yesterday when I told all the kids like, Oh, you want to make a list of over the best product out there like okay, everyone's googling proverbs and like you're just putting your ideas out there and post
22:07:20 it notes like I literally did it, and they had fun and it wasn't corporate or like Stanford, or whatever it was just fun. And we just did it, or like when I made, I made them all like, basically, visualize the HTML structure with Halloween candy.
22:07:37 That's all this exercise or like I taught them about
22:07:42 like we're, you know, collaboration and like who does what like okay you're going to do the CSS and you're going to do the HTML and you're going to do the research, how are we all going to talk to each other and talk to them about like, teamwork and,
22:07:54 like, you know, why it's important to like write clean code and what like a lean project management style looks like there's another kid that was like she didn't remember the other physical how many other physical things did you do with them, like with
22:08:08 objects and stuff like that, like candy with HTML stuff was there other stuff like that.
22:08:13 I'm
22:08:20 worse, like, like moving people around in the space.
22:08:22 Um, how did you control that room. Not too much like it would never be one instructor, so like I can only you know like sometimes I'd get half the room, or sometimes like I'd be popping around like with the students that just worked better with me.
22:08:36 When I like sometimes I would like move kids like like Okay you guys are all working together in a group, if you want to all talk to each other because kids are just.
22:08:44 Everyone was supposed to work on their own laptop by themselves, but then sometimes like one can be like a half hour like look at this me and I'm putting in my website and then like two other boys would pull up and they don't like.
22:08:56 Or like, you know, watching some like gamer streamer on YouTube and like kind of going on.
22:09:03 watching some like gamer streamer on YouTube and like kind of going on. And I was like okay there's this energy like kind of all getting together. So instead of, I never tried to my whole thing was about like noticing what kids were doing naturally like
22:09:16 Oh this one wants to like play a clicker game I'm going to teach him how to make one, this girl like you know she likes to look at screen savers like fun.
22:09:24 html websites, let's just go into like p five jazz and figure out how to make like good cheater, figuring out what their interests are and then trying to carve the path for them.
22:09:35 So it wasn't always like physical stuff and sometimes like you know we don't have doing.
22:09:40 Were you reading like pedagogical stuff about this approach, no or did you ever read any of that stuff and that was just like I read some stuff with that but but like I never actually related to my workout you code because like the stuff I had to read
22:09:56 it back I had a lot to do is, like, really outdated kind of very theoretical stuff. I read a lot of Ivan Lh with D schooling society stuff and which is like, cool.
22:10:08 So, what's that is that I've acknowledged the schooling society. Okay. And just in general I village, I like him but I also don't subscribe to everything, and I don't think it was influenced really right yeah you were just following, but you were you
22:10:25 were paying attention to the user, quickly and you were like trying to figure out what they're interested in. And a lot of the time that would be just talking with them like a lot of the girls needed people to talk to.
22:10:39 There is this one girl that had, like lots of girls had ADHD symptoms, and I just gave them the tools to deal with them.
22:10:50 There is
22:10:55 what I was what I want to interrupt this for one sec.
22:10:59 The other this is UI UX project.
22:11:04 Well how do people interact with that day or what was your, what was the experience like after you wanted people to interact with that. What was that like, um, they liked the things I liked when we walked around it quietly.
22:11:19 They took selfies in the mirror and when I wrote the text and, most of all, and that was kind of satisfy you and stuff. I liked the selfies.
22:11:31 I mean, I was like, I wasn't super satisfied. It was a group show with like a very varied concept and was kind of like, I felt like
22:11:44 at the time like my, my biggest complaint about all my work was that I'm just to text heavy and I'm too dense look into conceptual.
22:11:54 I just was so fun to, like,
22:12:03 I forgot that was always looked up as you were singing I was like Oh What is that like a tick tock thing.
22:12:10 I'm sorry I'm a little under the weather.
22:12:13 Well, I think that that the reason why I wanted to just ask you a quick question about that is because the UK stuff, but it's basically the same kind of work that you're doing, you know, you go in and out every day and you have this opportunity to first
22:12:26 of all you have users with the direction they have something that they want they have a goal, you know, which is still learn stuff they're there for the year users are there for a reason.
22:12:35 And the reason is an art.
22:12:37 But that allows you to operate as an interaction interaction designer in a really cool space because you can develop something like this. You know explanation of the HTML hierarchical tree or whatever with candy and they're all interacting with it and
22:12:51 it's all working and, and it's probably very different from the way people are interacting with your cool conceptual group art show thing. Right, but but this is the same activity that you're doing it's the same tendency that you have as an artist in
22:13:04 a very different context in one context it's working and giving you a lot of positive feedback, until maybe it stops working because of other bureaucratic things but in another context it never really worked, or you never got the solo show where it could
22:13:16 have worked right or the space wasn't right or people weren't prepared enough or maybe you weren't ready but, But, you know, the tendency to create interactions for people is there, and trying to find the context in which those interactions can have the
22:13:31 most meaningful impact on their lives is also there, you know, whether it's, you know, working at you code or doing a little group show, you know, and trying to kind of like, make these funky labels for for makeup.
22:13:45 Right, it's the same core idea you're trying to teach through special arrangements of objects.
22:13:51 Right.
22:13:52 And you're also trying to let people kind of play with stuff you're kind of trying to create a toy for people to play with, or an interface for people to play whether that's interesting that even called that UI and UX it's kind of funny.
22:14:06 You know, there's some a joke about how like people are confusing what UI is and what UX is a lot of the time and I thought it was like a like me just, I don't know.
22:14:16 I feel like that, this is a pretty convoluted.
22:14:22 That's it, that's like we could defensive it's like self referential feeling. I don't think it's anyway.
22:14:30 Yeah, but it's the social practice thing that's core. Right.
22:14:38 Um, so how to do treats and when we first started really, it started to finish that story.
22:14:48 Anyway, after Netherlands I was in Russia and I didn't have a lot of Adderall and I was with Eli Smirnoff phenomenal. And like, Ilya was shorting a lot of my Adderall at parties.
22:15:03 So I ran out.
22:15:05 And I couldn't get any in Russia, because I don't know if I like already told you the spiel about Scientology and Adderall anti psychiatry and that whole industry in Russia, but whatever.
22:15:15 You can't any issues and real in Russia, and you can't get outside of means or prescription students.
22:15:22 So I was like okay, herbs, you know, I'm going to go to the Russian herb shop and find it and I was, I basically made like a, you know, herbal adopted in whatever no tropics doc for myself from Russian herbal shop.
22:15:35 That was working for me and I was like, oh, like, what if I try to do one that did like another feeling like okay I feel like focused and secure. Now, what if I want to feel like, you know, like sexy or whatever so I went in and like bought more ingredients
22:15:49 and I was like okay I made myself like a tea and a jam that I was run on toes because basically I would just boil everything down and either with sugar or into a tea and like consumed and I was like okay, this is annoying.
22:16:02 This is like forgetting stupid that I have to like make this disgusting jam for myself to like those myself into the mood I want and I was like what if it was yummy candy or something.
22:16:12 And I went to this one store and it had literally green little gummy bears with.
22:16:19 I think it was spirulina.
22:16:21 And I was like, Oh, wait a minute.
22:16:25 And I saw they were full of sugar. And I was like, and I am non food. I don't know if it was Lucy or Sean who responded to me but they're like oh cool it's really funny I was like, non food dummies one and they're like that's a cool idea but these are
22:16:41 probably full of sugar infected. And I was like, Yeah, they probably are. And then I just went like.
22:16:55 And like, you know, did a bunch of Adderall with Julia and on, I guess I still had a little and I could do it at parties or whatever, or we were just up and I wrote, and I like drew out all of these different ones, I don't know when we diary from that
22:17:05 time is.
22:17:07 But like I drew out a bunch of concepts of nutrients like the aura Boris one and like little fighter jets that like you know give you this effect and like basically the concept that was like you take this candy that's made of all these are both concoctions
22:17:23 in it like through a third mood and label.
22:17:27 And then the more research I did into this like the consumer packaged goods space and interesting article space, though, like, you know, what you already have a really strong predilection for it.
22:17:39 Yeah, cuz I like to chop it down white person stars whenever also you love to make labels and copy that stuff and mimic that right, yeah, the way that you learned design is through mimicking packaging so.
22:17:54 Right. Um, so yeah, I was really into that and I mean also like the before I went to Netherlands I did a
22:18:05 want actually if I have it on here.
22:18:22 No, it was a work though.
22:18:22 I did a really funny
22:18:36 protein pancakes, like a vapor wave 1310 big design.
22:18:41 And then I just made it look kind of normal.
22:18:45 And that, like I've been working on the protein pancakes mix design was like this is so this was like, some of the you know I was like doing this research.
22:18:58 And then I really didn't like the client thumb is UCLA kid was like your cringe like your style is like wanted to do like this much every time I sit the package I'm like yeah, which one, that one, the one that they also make those, those toothpicks is,
22:19:19 yeah, I always loved that brand did a great job.
22:19:21 Yeah. Like you can see kind of like where my Vipers and where they're, like, this is like this is what their logo was before I was just like, um, anyway, that was probably that also like I was like oh I really want to do like the cool branding like I
22:19:37 really like non food like what is one of non who didn't taste like shit but it was also good for you like. And can I kind of rip them off what about, you know, go ahead, go ahead.
22:19:50 I think I kind of rip them off, but I didn't feel too bad about it so just like I'm not trying to do an art project like I actually want this to be a business.
22:20:00 And I'm just being in a project spending but like I, I decided to just treat it like a business and then what's the difference between a business and an art project.
22:20:11 I cared a lot I cared more about like market validation, and like getting to market and just, you know, making sure that this was something that could scale, and that was interesting to like huge stores.
22:20:29 More than I cared about actually manufacturing or researching that a little bit, which is, I really like their approach, actually I think that I would have benefited from having, you know, your food scientists to work with me creatively.
22:20:56 To create some really beautiful. What's the difference in approach.
22:20:48 I will they were like exhibiting their stuff as artwork. Yeah, they would they would like do an opening, like they do like a test tasting task, but it would be an art opening, or like, even if they went to the Food Fair, they would be like showing people,
22:21:05 the fragrance of like their ends like, dude, you don't need to figure out the fragrance of your algae bar, usually and figure out a way to make it taste good with your food scientist, and then like, test it with as many people that like have really basic
22:21:19 food pallets and not and make sure that people like it and then just ship it you know if you're going to do to see like figure out like a half to get it really popular don't just rely on your art connections to buy non food stuff right so non food non
22:21:33 food is non food as a project about poetic signaling.
22:21:40 And you want to do your project you, you're basically what you're saying is you stole the poetic signaling from them.
22:21:45 But then try to actually, but with the intent of trying to actually just do it.
22:21:51 My intent was more toward like I'm gonna kind of signal in the same way. Mainstream way because I'm actually doing it right. That was like your angle.
22:22:01 Like, there's this whole idea of, like, like the drop culture, you know procreating like shoot were dropped culture in collaborating with like, artists, or whatever to make, you know, to create hype to actually sell stuff so it's a very already, but like
22:22:15 like it's not art.
22:22:17 It's just kind of gummy candy.
22:22:22 And, And like it's conceptual and all this trash, but like, that's just a vehicle to get, you know, get the actual package in your cart. And have you checked out.
22:22:36 And I am like I I cared more about learning about the business side and manufacturing side, a lot more than caring about this like branding and conceptual side because I felt like I kind of had that done.
22:22:49 And I really struggled with finding people to work with, and to learn from.
22:22:55 But I developed a relationship with startup UCLA, because of nutrients and learned a lot about business and running things and, you know, made a lot of mistakes which were really beneficial for me when I was doing a treat.
22:23:12 it and then I dedicated so much energy to it. Because that was something I did for me. And I think more than any buddy I've benefited from it a lot.
22:23:20 Even though it also like I care about it so much that I can be construed as my head.
22:23:25 But yeah, I mean like after that initial moment of, oh my god this is a great idea, it. There is two things going on one was like, Oh, I could use this as a business or as a project and like I did actually make money out of school and like become a, you
22:23:42 know, rich, like candy magnate is sick.
22:23:56 And a lot of sleep, anxiety about graduating and like career stuff was taken away. So I was like oh just be my own boss, the entrepreneur people always send me that meant to be or whatever.
22:24:00 Um, but then there's this other part where I just like this is my thing. This is how I define myself like, you know, welcome. I am my co founder and CEO of nutrients Corporation, and it was avatar for you.
22:24:13 It's all good. I was like, This feels nice. Like, I didn't introduce myself to something and like people treated me with respect and like they had, you know, people responded to the pitch positive way.
22:24:29 Um, and, you know, that wasn't really helpful for developing the business but it was as an identity. It was so comforting. And it was so enjoyable and it just, like, I really liked it.
22:24:41 And at a certain point I stopped liking it, because I felt like I was trapped in it but in the very beginning, it felt very comfortable.
22:24:50 When did I stop liking it. When did you start to feel trapped in that identity. After feeling so positive about it.
22:24:58 When I began. It was at the same time that I realized I was struggling with delivering on the timeline that I put out for myself.
22:25:06 I was like, Oh, I'm not making this like, I don't deserve this name because I actually can't produce, like I can't, I can't hire the people that I can.
22:25:25 How long of a time span as I started happening in March to April, I mean it also had to do with the people I was thinking, like, you know.
22:25:32 Yeah.
22:25:44 Everything always gets wrapped up in that you can't help it. I know,
22:25:44 but let's say thanks for talking about nutrients actually that was really helpful.
22:25:49 I wrote down a bunch of stuff it helped me actually understand what you understand art as.
22:25:55 Especially, but you want to just spend a few more minutes talking about, like, the actual stuff for this class, the fries stuff and this I saved this Bratton essay in my nutrients channel,
22:26:11 and empathy. That's really funny
22:26:22 interrupting you.
22:26:24 Yeah, the actual stuff for this class. Okay.
22:26:27 Yeah, if you don't mind, can kind of head back to that VM the boarding pass. Let's start with that, Let's look.
22:26:37 So tell me about this. I printed this out for my little brother, as his Christmas present, it was, it was like supposed to represent.
22:26:47 This is the important part.
22:26:56 Yeah.
22:26:53 So like, it's really so much like the stuff that I used to make where it's like, it's one you expect like one type of content but actually I'm using this like very predictable, very like this this visual vehicle that we are, we know what to expect and
22:27:13 but like you have to really look at it to see what it says yeah it's it's a Trojan horse basically you do it and a lot of your work. Yeah, yeah.
22:27:18 It's really cool. Like, and then just like putting like a random for 21 like I can't figure out what else do
22:27:27 you know one of the nice things about nutrients, is that you didn't have to do that.
22:27:31 Right.
22:27:33 All of a sudden, you felt like you could have an identity through this project because you were no longer taking on the images that didn't belong to you but you're actually starting to develop your own images, And you do feel a little bit guilty about
22:27:47 maybe stealing, or having a project similar to the non food people, but even, but even then, you're so you're, you're adjacent to it, you're not actually it, right.
22:28:01 So, one of the really interesting things about that project is one you felt like you could use that as an identity. And I think the reason why is because you weren't relating.
22:28:10 You weren't directly hooking on to all those existing brands or imagery imagery, you were building your own imagery.
22:28:19 And that's really important because it seems like you haven't actually found an identity in any of your projects, other than that one. And that's the one where you're actually developing your own your own picture of the world.
22:28:32 I mean I. It was also similar to like, you know, using the design, like predictable design as a vehicle to do something else in the sense that like when I was doing sketches of the packaging.
22:28:45 I often.
22:28:47 Like, I mean, most internet you would lose your skills, your skills to take stuff, but to take stuff, but it was not so much them, or like the stuff.
22:29:00 Branding
22:29:00 nutrition label legal stuff.
22:29:03 And then like text you know like copy. So like a lot of creativity and a lot of like I love type so a lot of stuff that I like would go here, but I always wanted it to go like, you know, here so I put stuff here in here.
22:29:21 Like, obviously you can't legally walk with the nutrition robot like doing things up here, a lot of people do that yeah you're, you're relating to that art form.
22:29:29 And like this was really fun for me to also try to fuck with this like to, because like I, you know, I learned to read. With this, I didn't actually know how to read Russian.
22:29:48 When I went to Russian school.
22:29:50 I learned how to read English in America.
22:29:54 and we move to Russia and I was put in the first grade, because everyone thought that I didn't know how to read and stuff.
22:30:01 And I read perfectly even though I had never learned how.
22:30:08 And I didn't really understand why I knew how to read it to me like I only, I think early real it's a couple years ago. So they made me skip a great and everything and move it to the spirit of my head I still don't know multiplication tables a little
22:30:20 all confusing the shooters put me in the right grade but, um, I thought I started thinking about it later and I realized that like I taught myself how to read Russian because I had all of this like Russian stuff in the house when we're living in the States,
22:30:33 and there's always Russian stuff obviously in the Russian house before I went to school and I was reading all these labels that goes using the exact same method that I was using to read English text you know right to love like the letters look like this
22:30:45 word sound like that. Yeah, and I can read, you know I learned to read in English I learned to read and Russian or even Latin and Greek, as long as I knew what the actual glyphs mean,
22:30:57 and I and I knew the Russian letters because my mother had taught me what the letters were independently, with the alphabet book.
22:31:06 So, I never read text and Russian.
22:31:09 But once they made me do it. I did it flawlessly.
22:31:14 And I really cared a lot about, like, like a bathroom air freshener labels and fantasize like like sometimes like my mom had this habit of reading books in the toilet.
22:31:29 So you taught you were taught through packaging, but then she would remove the books from the toilet sometimes because like you're not supposed to read books on the toilet, but like, obviously I would do too because she kind of taught over.
22:31:42 So the only thing left to read was The air freshener and then like in the morning, you know I was an avid reader like I would get in trouble for reading at night with a flashlight, I would read the cereal boxes i'd reduce.
22:31:54 So, it was me like having fun things to read too because if I read textbooks that were really screwy looking.
22:32:01 I remember being mad at that and like gravitating towards a nice fancy color textbooks because I wanted.
22:32:08 Yeah, it makes total sense you were taught you were taught how to read the world through reading packaging, in some ways, and so it only makes sense that, even today.
22:32:18 When you think about project ideas, you want to insert yourself into that world because you know so well. So, the idea that you want to put some text somewhere where it usually shouldn't suppose isn't supposed to go on a label or whatever is you actually
22:32:30 inserting that stuff. Trying to insert the knowledge that you've gained as a, as a grown up or as a teenager into your childhood, wishing that you got it sooner.
22:32:40 And that's also connected to your whole pedagogical educational thing, so it's like you know we all grow up in these media environments and we have images surrounding us you know you could you could have attached yourself to anything didn't have to be
22:32:52 the packaging, but it was packaging for you.
22:32:55 Right, so you have to centralize that as like an important component in your practice I think. And that's also why you're so interested in all these artists like Jenny, the reason why you wrote Jenny holds her down.
22:33:05 Right, because they figured out a way to do that.
22:33:08 Right. She figured out a way to kind of do it and then, and then send it backwards through the channels. Right. And you want to send stuff back through the back channels to.
22:33:20 Right.
22:33:20 You know you want to be in the mainstream or whatever because you had an upbringing that was means, you know, unique but mainstream like you know and have a certain kind of class, like, a lot of us did not have you know not every artist or every classmate
22:33:34 of yours has the same.
22:33:37 of yours has the same as that same experiences of the similar class or feels the need to teach anyone, you know, or wants to do anything with packaging or had an experience like that so all this stuff is actually the content of your practice, but a lot
22:33:52 of it you're not actually talking about as subject matter you're just kind of making invisible and actually putting it down and saying like, oh yeah I just like, I like to do packaging, you know, when in reality it's actually a big deal.
22:34:03 And there's plenty of stuff that you could be actually reading about it, and engaging with just about that, you know, just about the the history of of images started, and you know fries too It's like you look at fries, as a, as a packaging thing you learn
22:34:23 through the packaging of the, of the surfaces, you know, you learn through the cut the coated surfaces of the environment. Right. You know that these environments that were in they weren't always coated in images and text, you know, and so you're a product
22:34:37 of of these environments that are like painted in this way. And so you want to put some paintings and back in those environments. Right. And part of what all your paintings are about is, you know, get out.
22:34:53 You know, wake up, or whatever, that's a big part of what the stuff is that you that you're doing and, and the and you know nutrients as a project is kind of interesting because you're like, oh maybe the only way I can actually finally get on the shelves
22:35:06 is if I make something marketable useful. Interesting. Actually scalable.
22:35:12 Right.
22:35:14 And something that isn't just me mimicking another brand or packaging, but but mimicking that stuff in a ghostly way, just using my skills as a designer to do it, you know, maybe ripping people off or whatever but making it your own thing, right.
22:35:29 So, so yeah i don't know i mean.
22:35:34 And then there's this whole designers art thing to in there, which you wrote about which I thought was an interesting phrase because, have you ever read that book designers are.
22:35:40 Do you know that Bruno minority book.
22:35:44 Uh, yeah then I bring it to the Ashland, did you.
22:35:48 Yeah, maybe. Yeah, well, okay so sure. I must have missed that. But, but there, you know, you're reading that book, that's good.
22:35:59 Because there's interesting thoughts about that in there and thing too, because there's a tension in wanting to do something.
22:36:07 Aesthetically for its own sake, and like wanting to have users, you know, and there's a real difference between a viewer in a user.
22:36:15 And I think, you know, ultimately you're someone who wants users.
22:36:19 But there are, but there are times when you know you're in this position where you kind of got into the art thing a little bit so you know the value of being a viewer, like a critical viewer, and you want people to look at your stuff and think, on that
22:36:34 level, but you also want people to not even really know about that stuff and just appreciate the stuff for its use value.
22:36:41 And I think that that's that is inherent in all your projects to, you know, the layer, the layering of that stuff right the conscious design of like layering that stuff together.
22:36:52 Right.
22:36:58 But yeah you know I think there's a lot of stuff that your work is about.
22:37:02 But you haven't yet made the, like, you're always thinking your work is about the subjects in the projects, but actually your work is about something else, and it would be nice if when creating this next project, you started to think about what is my
22:37:21 work, about in general.
22:37:23 As you're making this project and think in general I'm this, but the subject right now is this, you know, and contextualizing that whole thing will make the project a lot a much much smoother ride and I'll be able to communicate about it a lot better
22:37:40 to, you know, it won't all be, you will just be pointing at the signs within the existing project, you'll be pointing at like all the stuff that supports it from the outside.
22:37:48 And that's really important because that gives your work context. And without context all you have is just a scrappy project that points to itself.
22:37:56 You see,
22:37:58 you're kind of losing their like, I don't know, I mean at this point I'm feeling like I'm, I kind of want to think smaller and think about like what does it mean to be making plans like making a capstone art piece in an interactivity in game section.
22:38:17 When like I don't even know what the fucking format of the show is going to look like online, and I feel incredibly discouraged actually from participating in the grill, like aspect of it because there's going to be a bunch of other like teenage brainless
22:38:37 running the show that I don't respect and I don't want to work with and I don't have the emotional energy to like, scream over and be like, no, we're gonna do it this way, this is the normal way to organize data structures and freakin idiot like I don't
22:38:49 want to do that and literally like whatever they do I'm like great but like I also can't do that because if I'm doing an interactive piece like I have to think about, like, if it was in a real gallery I have to think like okay is it be in this part of
22:39:14 room, or is it going to be in that part of the room like what is like the person going to be feeling or like looking at when they're looking at my work.
22:39:12 And if it's done in the internet space like when I was when I was in grad school, I had a really good professor.
22:39:23 And I came to him with an idea for my thesis show.
22:39:29 And I was doing a lot of like role playing game that I was, I was kind of doing like Brody Condon kind of stuff at the time, and like experiential things.
22:39:40 And I came to him with this proposal. And what I wanted to do is I wanted to rent a short bus that had video screens in it, or like a coach best you know what I mean like you can take to the, they're not too hard to read, it's like $400 or whatever I
22:39:54 wanted to rent a coach best.
22:39:57 to rent a coach bus. I wanted to coach bus to take everyone from the sculpture building to Chucky cheese, which is a relic of the 90s that I was researching and a super interested in because Nolan Bushnell who's the former head of Atari, he designed Chucky
22:40:12 cheese and designed it as like a cleaned up, non druggie arcade experiences that was a lot of similarities between Chucky cheese, the world of Chucky cheese retail experience and the world of fries retail experience.
22:40:25 He's like early kind of, you know, computer before the internet kind of stores like entertainment, like things or whatever.
22:40:33 Anyway,
22:40:35 so I wanted to help design a video that would play on the bus, so everyone would be watching the video on the bus.
22:40:43 And then they would arrive at the the Chucky cheese and then I was going to rent out one of the party rooms, which has these really weird carpets and you've off.
22:41:00 place but you really don't where it's like you know these weird birthday party rooms, but like weird colored carpets so kind of like this like empty dead relic of like childhood, that was totally stripped, and then I was going to happen I was going to
22:41:06 fit the party room with some objects, you know like use that as the space for my show, and have some artifacts in there for people to look at.
22:41:15 And I was even thinking of just having the party room be empty, and then play a role playing game inside with everyone.
22:41:23 And my professor said something really, really important to me that I'll never forget.
22:41:28 And he said like your, and he basically said Jeffrey your job as an artist is not to take us to the thing that you're interested in, is to take the thing that you're interested in to us.
22:41:38 And it doesn't have to look anything like the thing that you want to take us too. And probably, it shouldn't either.
22:41:45 You know, and that and he's like that's just how it is.
22:41:50 And I wrestled with that for a long time. I was like, no, it's like that doesn't make sense because there's so many contemporary artworks where you go places or it's kind of about that are, you know, you know relational aesthetics Baba blah blah, like
22:42:03 whatever.
22:42:05 And it took me a long time to kind of understand that I mean I listened to him because he was like No, so he like shut it down, that I was really upset.
22:42:12 And then I realized that, you know, there's a big difference between internalizing the stuff that you care about and synthesizing something new, versus just showing people the stuff you care about, and displacing it from its original context, you know.
22:42:30 And, yeah, and the truth is that some artists do but some artists do that some artists display stuff and show it to you some artists don't do that but they were giving me a really strong opinion that they had about what they thought art meant.
22:42:43 And I didn't trust it at first but it took me a while to understand what that actually was. and it's a personal challenge. it's really hard.
22:42:51 You know, because it's because the challenge is to fully consume and embodied the subject matter. And then actually be able to make something new from it.
22:43:07 I don't know if I'm like putting that challenge in front of myself with my work, I think, like, I'm putting, kind of like really
22:43:19 basic and simple challenge in for myself, which is like complete something that looks finished and doesn't make me feel ashamed.
22:43:29 Um, you know like, make it work.
22:43:32 Even if it's trash or like doesn't accomplish like the big spiritual goal like me at work, like light it properly in like gallery lighting way make it look.
22:43:44 You know, like stand in front of it, wearing a black turtleneck I'm just feeling.
22:43:48 I did this I did a good job.
22:43:51 this I did a good job. Um, and it's.
22:43:54 It sounds really unambitious and boring but to me that's like, I don't know, it's like actually had him a lot because I don't finish things I don't polish them I don't like you know I don't document like the work that I was showing you from like ages
22:44:09 ago was like, it's all like pixelated and like, you know, re upload 100 times I'm like this weirdly person on security to them say, Oh, this isn't worth saving.
22:44:20 Like, this isn't worth exhibiting like my website isn't worth maintaining.
22:44:38 No, I'm so there's that but like, you know, there's also there's this pressure on a capstone project that like, it is somehow is like, Yeah,
22:44:38 a little further beyond the capstone I'm just talking about you. Yeah, I know, I know, I mean like Capstone is just 10 weeks of your life. That's all.
22:44:51 I mean, it's also like the last two weeks that, and also the first 10 weeks that I get to work in this format.
22:44:59 Because like we never, we don't like it, they don't train us do this, it does well they trained us to like follow assignments and do projects, and we never were thrown into this like critique later about when I was teaching there and I apologize for all
22:45:14 my, my peers us as educators.
22:45:20 Yeah. Um, it's, it's not an art program.
22:45:24 And then you're asked to do art at the end.
22:45:27 And yeah and then a lot of kids don't aren't prepared for that and they fail because they don't have any context for what that is or what that looks like.
22:45:35 Yeah.
22:45:36 Yeah, it's weird and like we you know it's not like we get studios like the grad students, or like the art students, you know, it's not like students have a really difficult time they don't even really know what it is they're doing.
22:45:49 That was my experience, does that was in the critiques and they kept asking me back, because it was like I'm not gonna lie.
22:45:57 That was in the critiques and they kept asking me back, because it was like I'm not gonna lie. But it was like really easy for me. And like everything I said they were like, and I was like guys like you're not even doing it, you know, you're like printing stuff out and putting it up.
22:46:08 Yeah.
22:46:08 So, there is definitely like, you know, one person who noticed that their, their students. Other students knew that too. It wasn't like everyone was dumb I'm not trying to like put myself up or whatever but you know there was a lot of tension between
22:46:21 the Desmond grad students and also the art grad students to, you know about them not being like a real, whatever. And then the Desmond students also kind of like knowing that they're like not doing that thing, but then being in the similar gallery space
22:46:34 or sharing the gallery space or having a critique and like thinking they're doing it.
22:46:39 It's, it's really two different worlds you know media art, and an art are two different conversations.
22:46:47 So I can, I understand that tension there and I know at the undergrad level it's there too and even, even kind of worse because you know a lot of the kids and a lot of your peers and Capstone they don't even really want to have these conversations at
22:47:00 all, they're not even thinking on this. I don't really want to. I mean, I want to have these conversations outside of Desmond a lot, and like, you know, thinking about like what my art career could look like outside of that is really interesting to me
22:47:13 like you know I could go back to talking about cinco actually in relation to that. Cuz I like, I went in before I called you like between the driving, I spent his whole day driving and I was mad I was like, I just want to spend time with my phone consult
22:47:28 I miss therapy because whatever tomorrow. I'm like, Oh, I just want to focus, and I was like, actually, I am upset and I was like I just need to tell him that I would say, because like, I'm going to be shooting pitch for like my own fault, and I just
22:47:41 need to communicate like my emotional state, like, this is like I have I'm in this state. And it's not anybody else's fault just like, I'm in this state right now.
22:47:51 Yeah, i.
22:47:55 Oh yeah there's, there's a difference, there's a difference to between, you know, you're shielded from the market a little bit, and my, my school experience had nothing to do with our careers whatsoever wasn't about career at all.
22:48:09 And so don't mistake, you know don't mistake art career with, you know, studying and doing you know critique and talking about art and stuff like that like Simcoe is just, you know, some because a guy who hawks artifacts he doesn't do any art stuff really
22:48:29 doesn't even really know about art stuff. That's why most people avoid him. I was really upset today.
22:48:31 In this in good thing because like victory didn't message.
22:48:37 I don't have clubhouse installed so gleefully did not even know.
22:48:42 I turned off my notifications, but like, talk to me. Remember how much he was hitting me up when I was in Ashland, yeah he was calling you every other day.
22:48:55 You don't call me text me anything may want to read my line in that he read.
22:49:03 He kept saying action when like people weren't. He's the. He's the worst director I like ever thought like I
22:49:17 don't even want to think about that thing.
22:49:20 And he's like, he like did like this like whole Thank you, like, actually, while like that he was like, giving flowers or whatever at the end of the show like I was waiting in there for ages with my mind badge, as the person who organized like the whole
22:49:33 discordance over and shit and like helped a lot in the beginning and then I was like okay like you're not sleeping dude like I can't interact. You know, like, you know, maybe you felt like I abandoned or whatever but like I was president and I know I
22:49:47 did my part that I did, or was there anything that happened tonight and this info room that made you think about your Capstone or what happened was that Victor didn't, message me about some codes room.
22:50:02 He didn't tell me what the topic was who the guest was, I show up at 802, because I'm a notification anymore for clubhouse good clubhouse decided to just give you unlimited notifications, even if you haven't on the lowest frequency.
22:50:15 Completely. Make sure I deleted it because it's, like, what do they think they're going to get like people are just going to disable the app, like if you if you start being.
22:50:25 If you start disrespecting your users and like the toggle that you created for them like talk about their needs and you just tell them what their needs.
22:50:32 We want engagement, before going to boycott you, they're like adding monetization but only for the time I saw it on like what was said in the way I show up, and like, Stefan stuff and he's always like, Hi you know like he's happy to see me he likes me
22:50:49 he cares about me he likes respecting me Victor's like oh yeah let's go along here like, you know, gotta run the show and I'm just like, dude, you're doing it again like some good yells at you all the time.
22:51:00 to like move along according to your script in your head, but there's no script it's clubhouse. It's in the crowd and like us you know I was just like, Anyway, Victor I went to frys electronics today like updating everybody with the news, you know, because,
22:51:17 like last time I spoke about fries and people were talking about it for like 30 minutes because we had an open room and it was interesting, I was like, anyway.
22:51:26 And there was like anyway we have this one guest we're going to talk about NF keys, and I was like,
22:51:32 um, and then I go home and I'm like shit I need to like start recording this on otter because this is my job, whatever. And I look go into the Google Drive folder that Victor owns.
22:51:44 And I see that he's already made a new doc based on like my design with my typography with my layout cloned it and we did it. And then he's using an otter link.
22:51:55 He doesn't pay for otter premium so he's only able to record 40 minutes which is like, just so satisfying to me that he fails at like, replacing me, but I just left there, like I was in the room for a little bit, I was like whatever you can get my followers,
22:52:09 fine, like I'm here. But once again I didn't get a word in edgewise I was just like, yeah, you know, I'm not needed here I'm not respected here. I'm not valued here.
22:52:18 My work is blatantly stolen. Like I'm just replaced by somebody who does it in a way that's inferior. And I was just like, why like, why am I even doing this in the first place I was doing this like just like you know laser only have a single relationship,
22:52:32 without actually contributing any yeah and also and also learn about the medium and stuff like that, but you weren't doing it to have your, your. I wasn't doing it for some soccer that doesn't know how to do my job to like do my job for me and take everything
22:52:49 that I worked and put together and added a ton of value that lots of people notice, and you don't think about it.
22:52:57 No, but, like, why don't you
22:53:03 interested in working with Victor I'm interested in working with Simcoe Victor is not the person I need to talk to you I need to go talk to some guy in real life, and like, you know, format, all of the work that I've done and show him and be like, this
22:53:13 is what I did, I can continue doing this, this is the way I do it, nobody's going to do exactly what I do it I can train somebody to do it, but like this is what I do, I'm kind of burnt out on talking about an excuse.
22:53:25 If you want me to recruit guests if you want me to do this and that I'm going to do that they're going to add monetization standard like, you know, either you can get all the coin or I can get the point but because I do work in the background.
22:53:34 I'm not going to be up there on stage like getting the point that I deserve. So, you know, like, I'd love to work with you in a way that's meaningful.
22:53:42 Maybe clubhouses not so meaningful, in terms of the collaboration.
22:53:56 No, and I think personal like I added a lot of value here, you know, whatever, just handed over and but like I just wanted. I want to be recognized for what I did, and not be like pushed around.
22:53:59 That's what it really hurt me.
22:54:01 So Simcoe is a person to talk to you not Victor.
22:54:04 What who is Victor.
22:54:06 Is he an artist. No. Is he like in LA. Know Who is He Who cares.
22:54:12 All the phone calls, just getting to know these guests know, I remember when I was telling you about how I think the charlatan. Yeah, I mean that's what that's what I, that's why I love Victor so much because you can ask that question and have no answers,
22:54:23 and that's what's so funny.
22:54:29 I'm like, the whole point of this work like I never intended like oh yeah I'm gonna start like doing some black clubs like Yeah, I got you 100% I know, yeah.
22:54:39 And like, you know, being pulled out from under you again on that. And it's the same story that's happened a lot and my guess is that you're not really, there's over it.
22:54:52 Yeah. And you know, I think.
22:54:56 Yeah, but to the.
22:54:59 I think it happened to with nutrients and you just are it's a little bit sharp you don't really want. It's a similar thing you don't really want to talk about it but I think I gotcha, gotcha wasn't, you know what happened with dacha to but I think it
22:55:12 also happened with the project that you did have that was your own that was part of your identity.
22:55:17 happened with the project that you did have that was your own that was part of your identity. And I think it happened maybe through that relationship somehow, or it was like confusing or, I think part of the reason why you didn't want to do nutrients anymore, was because you felt like you were all of a sudden under
22:55:26 because you felt like you were all of a sudden under the umbrella of maybe criticism of something else that already did go to market, and you were like, fuck like, it's not mine and like all of a sudden maybe it didn't feel like you're yours anymore I
22:55:40 don't know but it sounds like the way that your things fail is a pattern to, you know, and then that you want to avoid that because you want to have something finished, like you said, and being a turtleneck and look good and be like this is done this
22:55:51 is mine, and you don't want it to be something that anyone can ever pull out from under you.
22:55:57 You know, part of that is not giving anything away to anyone in something, part of that is not having any collaborators and or just being in total control from the very beginning.
22:56:10 You know, and not giving anyone a piece of it, you know, not not not surrendering to anyone else's criticism of it or whatever, that's a big part of it.
22:56:22 And part of it is just being able to take criticism and then saying no, that's stupid or, you know, a lot of its confidence.
22:56:29 You know you want to have work that you're fit that's finished that you feel confident in that can be confident when like you are making things for other people.
22:56:38 Yeah, asking what to do it on, you literally can't do it, because you putting yourself in a clerical position.
22:56:46 You know, and you said it yourself, you know clerical work for you is super easy you literally do it like for other people like without thinking about it like you made those adrenal channels for the whole class or whatever like you literally do that stuff
22:56:56 because you're thinking you're helpful but that's also what's robbing yourself of opportunities to build your confidence.
кшт
22:57:39 I see that way to like bigger my website or Instagram or whatever that my gosh she's a legitimate person like of course, you know like, she's not all this stuff she's it's not about, it's not a question.
22:57:51 It's not a question of it's not a question of authenticity in me inside me I feel like I know it's not a question of authenticity, from the inside or the outside.
22:58:06 It's a question of self confidence that, that you have, you know, that does that changes the way that you actually feel about the stuff that you make, you know, and in turn, that will help you, like, not fail the same way.
22:58:26 In future projects.
22:58:21 You know, I mean you're really good at putting your foot down and stuff, but, and everyone's kind of good at putting their foot down with certain things, but there's always things that, you know, we're, for better or worse, for better or worse, that we
22:58:33 all have weaknesses in certain respects about like, Oh, I just, you know, I can't. Like, that's something I do automatically I don't know why I do it, but I always happens, you don't mean, and I think with you and your creative work it's.
22:58:49 This is one of those things you know it's gonna it's this is one of the big struggles of you getting stuff out in the world.
22:58:56 You know, not every artist has the same one, the same struggles, you know, somewhere to share that struggle that you have seen it before. You know I have friends who have the same thing.
22:59:05 I don't have it I'm lucky, you know what I mean I didn't work, it didn't work out for me that way. I'm sorry, I didn't I built my confidence automatically it was fine.
22:59:13 Some people don't you know I know how to do it, though.
22:59:18 And And a big part of it is not working for other people.
22:59:25 Yeah, yeah, I'm really nervous right now as a leader, you can probably, you've seen it and you can tell I'm like wow this is like kind of fucked up to other people are like, under me, because it was always me before and I was super confident in that and
22:59:36 now that I actually have something that other people are like swirling around in the reason I'm nervous because I'm afraid that their confidence won't have a path to grow, the way that minded.
22:59:45 That's one of my major fears, with my project is that I'm not going to give the people underneath me enough opportunity to build their own confidence as artists.
22:59:53 So, you know, this is a huge thing. This is a huge thing for artists.
22:59:58 You know, Camille and Alex are artists do they want this for themselves. It's part of its part of part of doing it.
23:00:07 But I think in terms of I don't know we can we can have another conversation about it but
23:00:13 in terms of the capstone thing.
23:00:16 Like, you're absolutely right, you know, make it small scope it for 10 weeks, make it all yours. Don't give it away to anyone else stand there and with a turtleneck, and and say that this is mine.
23:00:27 It doesn't have to be this, this amazing thing that represents all five, all the last decade of you being in LA. It doesn't have to be something that everybody sees all it has to do is, you know, not, not be something that can be taken away from you.
23:00:43 That's all.
23:00:44 You know, I think that's the main goal here.
23:00:48 You know, it could be the start of something to doesn't have to be the ending.
23:00:56 You know, but it has to be something you can stand in front of and that can't be removed from behind you.
23:01:00 That's, that's for sure.
23:01:05 And I think, doesn't matter really matter what idea you pick you know you've got your two ideas, you've got other ideas but.
23:01:18 And you'll talk to Chandler about picking the best one, but the important thing is that it's not something that can be removed. Can't be deleted, you know, and it's not something that you're going to want to have on your hard drive as it should be. jpg in five years. it's something that you're going to want to keep the high res
23:01:26 files for.
23:01:28 It has to be something that's that important to you.
23:01:35 And something that if you lost the hard drive that had those files on it you will cry. that's the goal that's the real goal,
23:01:43 to not put your own project down.
23:02:05 mean if I can get a UFO I keep pretty proud of that
23:02:12 was a cool idea.
23:02:13 I like the idea. I don't know how to make it interactive or whatever but if I could just get it.
23:02:21 I don't know, it's so I'm so scared actually because like I got I wanted a liquidation sale today and I heard a rumor from the guy doing it running the sale I'm like, you know, nobody just like some liquidation contractor the auctioneer died and he was
23:02:38 the guy that ran be one of the fries I the CEOs probably Randy.
23:02:43 Randy is going to take all these fixtures, you know, so like the actual displays, but without the prince the prince belong to the library and Oxnard so I shouldn't need to get into boxer library and stuff and not from there.
23:03:01 Um, I don't know if I should do social engineering or not, like, really tough to figure out like hello this is a representative from frys electronics.
23:03:13 You know, like I said before, I gave you some advice, like he's gonna make a museum of all this sudden like all this branded stuff that he's not throwing away like that stuff it's inside the stores
23:03:27 on an island that he owns in the Bahamas he own seven islands in the Bahamas, like, and like I'm just trying to like use my brain to figure out what's going on with fries, and I feel like what's happening is like, maybe five years ago, everything was
23:03:41 kind of chill, but I think what's happening is that there's family drama.
23:03:46 Because otherwise why would the business I go so so wrong.
23:03:50 Like, they started doing consignment like we're moving towards a consignment model to lifesaver business and like then they claimed Kobe and with online sales destroy them.
23:03:58 But what really destroyed them i think is the fact that they're doing like a three brother business.
23:04:03 Someone started fighting over something, and then they just become became really shooting managers and stop being able to actually work together. Like I don't think they're actually the bad CEOs are bad at their jobs I think what happened was there.
23:04:20 What. Wait, 41 days ago,
23:04:28 prize is actually a front to Lauren victims for a cabal of semen drinking vampires based out of a Randy fries island in the Bahamas.
23:04:41 Nice.
23:04:42 This is like some jokester
23:04:53 painful to look at this read it.
23:04:56 Right.
23:04:58 So this is like some guy that
23:05:03 well yeah so then they get so everyone knows what the items.
23:05:08 But like okay so I'm sure that Randy's a bad guy. And like I have his email but what am I going to do, like email him and be like, hey, Randy like you can drink my blood on your island in the Bahamas I really want the UFO.
23:05:21 I'll take it.
23:05:24 Like, how do I ever get it, and he's not gonna want me to have any road destroy it. Do I like literally put myself on like like climate and like stand there like a tree sitter be like, if you want to like knock this thing down the Wrecking Ball you gonna
23:05:36 have to kill me first going to make it fun media story, but like,
23:05:42 do you um, if I save the UFO. Do you want to say you want to save the UFO or you want to take the UFO.
23:05:53 I don't want it I don't I don't even like only open myself. It'd be great if it was public if it was a playground.
23:06:03 I want kids to play with it I want like I want to be like this random kid who was able to save the UFO from frys electronics, it was going to get demolished and give it back to kids who just want to play with computers and technology and fantasies, like
23:06:19 if I say that you are for backing like proved in my little brother that anything is possible that you can do whatever you want, like he can build a computer from scratch, he can will steal your phone from the store, like you do anything you want in this
23:06:33 world, and like, that's that's you know that's like, that's what all this like wake up should is about like, I want to tell people to wake up I want them to literally wake up.
23:06:49 It's like climbing over cement structure and like screaming and playing and laughing and like just doing crazy should have their own
23:06:57 big desires for a small project. But yeah, well, interactivity has to be interactive so you know it's gonna have to.
23:07:05 Well the interactivity doesn't have to come from the, from the product, it can come from the process and the process is already pretty interactive. And that's also why I was suggesting to you earlier, and doing that by the way, documenting everything
23:07:20 like I when I went to the store today I took tons of pictures like I'm you know my, I run my own Discord server like that's well documented but.
23:07:28 Right.
23:07:29 Read it.
23:07:32 And if you're doing it because because as much as this project is about death, it's also about desperation. And when someone's dying in your family, what you can, you can fold them written handwritten receipt, the liquidation guy gave me like pink slip,
23:07:46 because I want to have a contract scam of it. Yep. Yep.
23:07:50 Good. So, yeah, I mean, you know, it's like what I was just gonna say is like you know when you're when your grandpa's dying all of a sudden, the first thing that happens is everyone's like, oh, like everyone got has to go visit grandpa like right now
23:08:02 like let's take pictures of him or whatever like it's all a lot of it's often about documentation and clearing out and documenting the process of death.
23:08:10 And so as long as you're doing that, I think you have the project but that's also highly interactive thing. And you can also think about how you might want to be involving others in it.
23:08:28 Safe calm also is like related to like, when I was setting up the Discord. I was like, it wasn't setting it up to like document that it was to create a new fries on the internet, because like you know you don't like the stock drops this word know.
23:08:45 No. So, like, if you want to get a really good GPU.
23:08:49 You go to stock drops.
23:08:53 I don't know why. Okay. And like they have, they don't all these bots were like you click the imagery that you want to figure out, like, and then you'll get an alert with like when this thing will drop for you.
23:09:05 Because these you know because of crypto then if he's or whatever like these are getting sold out really quickly. So you really need to be online when the stock drops.
23:09:14 So this is like a whole discourse or is just about buying like that. This is what fries turn into, you know, like, a community of people like people like caring about is now this, so I was like what if I made like fries, but like, you know, how do I recreate
23:09:42 like the specialty shopping experiences like a certain things also very social. And like very American and like, you know, very cultural in this way. And what if I like figured out a way to do it in like that the space that like kids are living in now,
23:09:50 you know like the tick tock feed this quarter like whatever maybe, maybe sonar like maybe shopping online should look like, like a little little map that like you know the till the town thing whatever.
23:10:02 Or like you know maybe, maybe, walking through different aisles looks like scrolling through a list like this, like this is an insane list. And it's funny because fries is an insane store, like you're using discord as a representational to create a representation,
23:10:18 we have a toilet here.
23:10:22 Like, you know people are like writing like things that are legit and then the loud pooping goes.
23:10:29 And this is super funny. And like you know I could write a bot for this and like really kind of make it, you know, maybe this is the product like you just go to my do sports or reprise electronics.
23:10:40 And like, then I make the website look better and, maybe, maybe there's some some sort of like, because I was talking about with a specialized like a non 3d.
23:11:01 3d is not a 3d on the internet, not the future. I don't like because we were talking about like how is this exhibition going to look like right now like oh let's let's use things like you know 3d internet gallery things are like, you know, it's like nobody
23:11:08 goes and experiences art in those places the way they experience in real life it's really bad.
23:11:14 But if you do something like, yeah, I forget to date, posting may not
23:11:24 fit with the senior means.
23:11:34 Yeah, we'll do.
23:11:43 Whatever.
23:11:43 I'm
23:11:43 not sonar you know center. Yeah, another like build a showing sonar, you click a thing. It's a piece.
23:11:54 Yeah, you know, but then why not, you know, you're, you're, I don't I don't know if anyone's gonna agree with my idea of doing it that way. So I don't even want to get involved in it like I'd rather just spend my other.
23:12:09 There's the real, there's a real physical death of the thing there's trying to save the carcass. And then there's the, the, you know, it's Easter, there's the rebirth in the virtual space of trying to, you know, have the spirit, right.
23:12:23 We the spirit you say already exists in this other larger community. So the spirit has been kept alive, essentially, so the work is done, but the work of remembering the packaging.
23:12:36 Right.
23:12:39 The retail design all the stuff that you personally actually care about that you're really stuff that you selfishly kind of care about. But this project, that's the stuff that isn't being done by that other big community right.
23:12:51 Like, you actually don't care about. I mean, of course you care about the cultural stuff the educational stuff the DIY kind of world of it but what you really care about is the aesthetics of fries, you know, and and and a specific message that it was
23:13:07 communicated through those aesthetics right.
23:13:11 through those aesthetics right. And I think that like
23:13:16 yeah you're trying to save that and rebirth that, but you're also trying to save the carcass the actual physical carcass of the thing so you know there's a lot that you're.
23:13:28 There's a lot that you're trying to save here or recreate. Right.
23:13:36 But like, maybe some of these things are not really reconcilable maybe like that there's this they're these two sides to this project and maybe they're only needs to be one side.
23:13:47 You know what, like it's you're throwing a lot of stuff into it.
23:13:53 You know, why am I, why am I not seeing also like a clubhouse role play room where it's like you're the tech help at frys and it's like fries the clubhouse room like, you know what I mean like why you know okay you say you say no to 3d, but then you say
23:14:06 then you say yes to 2d with sonar, you know so so no roadblocks but sonar okay no Minecraft but Minecraft would be fine if it's in Minecraft, if it's already in that environment, I don't want it to be like a not like a whack like browser.
23:14:21 The thing is, like, if it's already in a world that is established it does exist like that makes a lot of sense.
23:14:28 But like, I don't know what what is the future of shopping for stuff like is it going to be dumb and voice based, I'll excellent order me more, like, you know, HDMI cables that glow in the dark, whereas discovery right like how do you actually discover
23:14:43 things.
23:14:45 Is it going to be like influencer marketing when you go on Instagram really whoa that's cool. I can't believe like he got those, you know, GPU chips are like, how are you going to, you know allows them to do to write like, Oh, that was another really
23:14:57 great computer and then they put the list of the products down and they have the affiliate links, but like oh the interface or commodities used to be retail space and then it became a search bar, and now it's becoming people in digital kissing booth,
23:15:11 those are those aren't good like maybe that's what exists and that's what like people are gravitating to right now. that's existing infrastructure, but that's not good.
23:15:19 And people don't like it like people don't even like Spotify because they're like, I want to really go to a record store and discover something randomly like truly randomly fucking algorithm I want like I want some like hot girl and walk by and like,
23:15:32 I want to look into her basket and just be like, I'm gonna listen to that record. You know I want to like, you know, I want to be like walking around frys electronics and like get lost, and then find this whole section of technological parts I didn't
23:15:46 know existed and changed my whole life direction. Yeah, browse ability. Yeah, I mean that's one of the saddest things about the internet is that it kind of killed the library to that way.
23:15:56 I know I know that I know that I appreciate and understand the sentiment, you know, you know this art project.
23:16:05 Mm hmm. Yep.
23:16:06 You like watch the video and everything you know about but haven't watched the video, but I know them and I know I've seen that image before they.
23:16:19 I don't know how to do it for this but they installed this,
23:16:26 they pretended to be Nike running have a sponsor, and they interviewed a bunch of people will think about it.
23:16:37 They were Nike and they did install this thing I am.
23:16:41 I really love this I really like I love yes when like yeah I gotcha Yeah Can I can I assign a piece for you to watch. Yeah, I'd love it I just don't use that.
23:16:58 And I'm headed to bed, very fashionable, you, Peter Pan was like Neverland, like you'd be like damn
23:17:09 Neverland yeah like shins of shopping first.
23:17:15 I thought was very good. It's been fun overhearing is about, you know, like what so you save Friday's right like the resurrection, Easter metaphor, which I really liked and that's like the discord server or whatever, but like, what do you do if you can't
23:17:34 save something right like they died so you like gave it a memorial, are you like that interacts with like every guy told you about my idea of like getting a great point at that Memorial, yeah surprise and putting the fucking thing there.
23:17:49 Yeah, no, that's it that's that is such a beautiful metaphor, moving the UFO from, like, literally, it's like 600 feet. Yeah I know, but just considering that as like a as another viable.
23:18:04 Sorry, not just another viable way of like giving a pleasure is not like necessarily like reserve damn but also. My name is Anastasia.
23:18:15 You're holding was you don't know what that means in Greek resurrection.
23:18:25 Am I dead. Right. Well, actually. Yeah. Did you know that that's what the name meditation means, and mind you this whole talk about like dad and my obsession with it or whatever may fixation and in my work and like my name that means reverse.
23:18:38 I didn't know that. That's good to know.
23:18:41 For me,
23:18:54 so I have, I have two pieces for you to to watch one of them is not online but I have a. I'm searching for my copy of it right now.
23:19:11 Do you have VLC player.
23:19:13 Yeah, I think so.
23:19:15 Okay.
23:19:18 Oh my god, What am I doing.
23:19:21 No wonder if I can.
23:19:26 It's on my private server but I'm going to download it real quick and then put on Dropbox and send it to you.
23:19:30 And then the other pieces by a Finnish artist.
23:19:38 They're both pieces of social engineering and they're both pieces.
23:19:54 That is Dropbox, that are about death and resurrection, in a way. What's that, yeah he's Dropbox. I'm not, I'm not gonna say anything about my feelings about it other than the fact that I'm a user.
23:20:03 Let's keep it at user has that.
23:20:18 I got mad at my dad for being a Dropbox user I got so mad at him that I bought him a Condoleezza Rice book.
23:20:25 Really, then he was like his to me.
23:20:36 board of directors. Here's the first one.
23:20:39 Will you watch the whole thing, and not be, and try to pay attention. Where is the whole thing. Whereas, it's not so it's just nine minutes it's not something that you can skip through and understand you kind of have to watch the whole thing.
23:20:53 Or you can only get to me or you can just show it to me right now. It's in the chat.
23:20:59 And then there's another piece that's also about the same duration that actually.
23:21:04 Yeah, I can try to.
23:21:07 It's still transferring but I'll send it to you.
23:21:10 It's by a Japanese artist Japanese video artist.
23:21:16 You should. Yeah, don't worry about reading anything you can just, you can just watch it.
23:21:22 I think that like, you know, this project is as much about.
23:21:29 it's as much about your relationship to this as it is about the thing itself. And so I think regardless of how you slice it you're going to be a character in this thing, you kind of already are.
23:21:40 So like, I think.
23:21:44 Yeah, the way that you actually are going to tell this story, and present a thing that represents this like subject of yours is is going to be really important you know what you reveal how you locate yourself in it, whether you're doing any social engineering
23:21:59 whether it succeeds or fails. You know how it kind of operates
23:22:05 is, is going to be crucial. And so I'm just, I'm going to send to you example, this example as a really great example of something that failed.
23:22:14 That still really works very well, and does everything, even more than it should and kind of will, will it will trigger your Yes Men vibes to.
23:22:27 And then there's another piece. The other piece I'm going to send you as about exploitation.
23:22:32 That I think you'll also like.
23:22:34 But that's going to take me a minute to upload. And then, then I think I have to go because I'm a little tired.
23:23:01 Been a long day.
23:23:19 There it is.
23:23:19 You just have, you're gonna have to use VLC player to open this thing.
23:23:34 And I can send you a page about this piece. The web page about it or something.
23:23:56 Well, I didn't already exists already worked for you know it, nevermind.
23:24:09 Is this already worked for you. Oh no wait, nevermind. Wait here.
23:24:12 Does that work does that link work for you already.
23:24:20 Can you watch that video.
23:24:29 Well, I can't believe that uploaded that fast.
23:24:38 And not only that, but it plays in the Web Player as a VOB file. That's amazing.
23:24:44 So, there's pieces.
23:24:46 It's by a Japanese video artists my real quizzing me.
23:24:53 And I think you'd like it for a number of reasons, it might not be super apparent why I'm sending you these two pieces right away so if you want you can ask me questions about them.
23:25:04 But I do think that you'll find a lot of, like, you know, it's, it's, I'm purposely sending you stuff that's a little bit different from what you want to make, because I think you'll find that the approach is maybe interesting and similar, you know.
23:25:24 And and I wouldn't want to send you like you know when I gave you that Tom socks reference for example, I was like giving you I was like, Oh, you could like do one of these, you know, that's not why I'm sending you these pieces.
23:25:36 You know, I'm sending you them because there's stuff, the internal about them that you can I think you can relate to that will help you, but it might not be like it's not like an image, it's not like you understand I'm saying right.
23:25:47 Yeah.
23:25:49 But there's a logic to them that you share that I think you'll appreciate.
23:25:58 Okay, I will watch and question.
23:26:02 Yeah, we're just watching them and enjoy them I think they're pretty, but but please watch them, give them your attention. I want to give you this
23:26:12 kind of side of it.
23:26:17 This is a.
23:26:19 This is one of Theos teaching science.
23:26:23 Oh, nice. this is what this is for.
23:26:26 mixed reality performance.
23:26:28 Like, and I don't know something about like the videos that we were just sharing kind of made me remember this lecture.
23:26:35 But like some of these. I had already seen some of these made me cry. Mm
23:26:49 hmm.
23:26:49 These are all kind of like more of a kind of timepiece the breakfast in bed one of those one of my favorite but that's probably the best video I've watched it in the last couple years that I've seen an art show.
23:27:01 Did you watch that piece in class.
23:27:03 Yeah, we watch like assignments from all of these. Okay, good. Just this wasn't the only one I want to show you is like.
23:27:17 It's kind of hard to find but like he has a good one.
23:27:21 I don't I can't find the actual syllabus, it was like this resources thing.
23:27:27 But.
