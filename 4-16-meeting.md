11:03:24 That brilliant Thank you, I appreciate that a lot of cool.
11:03:30 I'm cool. Yeah. So, my project.
11:03:37 I'm still. I'm a little embarrassed by the proposal that I made so just, oh and can you enable screen sharing so I can show it to you. Yeah.
11:03:49 There you go.
11:03:52 So I should have everything linked in my GitHub repo for this, which I'm organizing right now because I realized that, like this is going to look, looking a bit crazy so.
11:04:19 I was actually wondering, do you think I should just keep all the other, like the readme is just in this main repo, or should I organism by a week do you care at all.
11:04:17 I think whatever makes the most sense for you.
11:04:21 I can adapt.
11:04:23 Okay, I'll probably just make like a naming convention where it just starts with the date or the week, so it's easier to just see like in alphabetical organization.
11:04:36 Okay.
11:04:38 Okay.
11:04:39 So, um, I think the smartest thing to do for the project is going to make just make the website really nice and turn that into a polished project. So something similar to the sunset foot clinic sign with my idea.
11:04:59 Um, and I like it a lot because it's simple. It's nice. It's, um, I really liked the reference because I like how I like how their design is both using modern tools, but it also has a solution to like previous era, which is something that's important
11:05:18 in the Fry's Electronics Memorial.
11:05:22 Yeah, so like, this is, this is nice I think they're using three jackets, which I'm not very versed in but I think.
11:05:32 I think I can figure it out.
11:05:36 Um, and then yeah I mean I also don't really like 3d modeling but I couldn't stand like making a single UFO, and I care about this UFO enough to do it, so it's like not.
11:05:50 and I'd be happy to do it that way.
11:05:52 Um, I do have a bit and then yeah so then it would like have a bunch of writing and I love writing so that that would be fun. But I do have a concern that would be the work would be kind of derivative of the sunset foot clinic sign website.
11:06:06 And also, in like exploring this whole idea.
11:06:09 I realized that, like, the hyper fixation on fries is pretty funny. And I think it you know it's relevant right now. But ultimately, the work isn't so much about fries or my obsession specifically with this one UFO or the phrase family, and I feel a little
11:06:28 like, I don't want people who you know I don't want Randy Dave and john fry to feel like I'm obsessed with them and their project because it's kind of annoying.
11:06:38 I realized that really the project isn't about even fries specifically to me.
11:06:43 It's about moralizing like a computer and technology, loving world that never happened and I feel like it's just never going to happen in the way that we all envisioned it in 2000s.
11:07:00 So I began thinking about more complicated projects like, I don't know if you know this reference, but querying the map. Okay. Um, I am actually friends with the author of this Lucas.
11:07:18 And I love the way that people can come in and add their own little stories. I think that's what I'm interested in to like I love to create some sort of environment and people come in and they can add their stories about fries or something else as well.
11:07:33 You see increasing amounts I don't need to load it right. Yeah, yeah, great project.
11:07:39 And then I wouldn't want to use a actual geographic map for my project because I don't think that the thing you know i don't think that the terrain that we're memorializing or that were morning is an actual geographic terrain it's not a physical place,
11:07:58 so I have to figure out some alternative representation, but I do like the idea of a map. I do like the idea of a 2d place because a big part of me, even starting this prize project was thinking about alternatives to physical shopping experiences.
11:08:21 As you know, one of the reasons that stores like fries and micro center and Radio Shack ended up shutting down is because commerce is happening on the internet and digital spaces.
11:08:33 There's a lot of room in e commerce to innovate, like the shopping experience so that was kind of my idea with the discord what would the social shopping experience look like they're already already scores where people will share links when like a certain
11:08:48 GPA drops as I know it's really popular like right now with the whole NFP craze.
11:08:53 Then I also was interested in exploring like specialized e commerce experiences because I find it mind boggling that we're still all of e commerce happens either in a list view or in a grid view and to me that's crazy because if you go into a real store.
11:09:12 Obviously, everything is arranged in grids around you, but it's super specialized so you have this really interesting kind of interplay of stuff and grocery stores have always been really interesting to me I had a project about it, the grocery store I
11:09:26 think maybe showed last time.
11:09:37 And it's very sophisticated with like the maze the experience that you go through like read taxes and cap and stuff so I think that the way I could explore that is by having several pages on this website.
11:09:44 So like one page would be the main Memorial page.
11:09:50 You write this down, which would be kind of like the sunset foot clinics and introducing it and then one page would actually just be like a 2d map
11:10:01 of the Burbank fries.
11:10:05 Okay. And then, I don't think this is going to happen in time for the exhibition but something that I think would be really cool is to have some sort of way for other people to contribute their memories.
11:10:19 Happens all the time whenever I talk about the project and I have even mentioned frys electronics closing down, or my feelings about it to anybody. I immediately get a response like i remember when i XYZ.
11:10:32 And when I hear that I'm just like, oh my god like that is so beautiful and valuable, that is like the memory that is the thing that we want to celebrate and to grieve and to share.
11:10:44 So, um, I talked a little bit to people at arena, about maybe using arena as an engine so people could submit text into kind of like a block and then it would all be hosted by them and then powered into the website.
11:10:59 I know you also do something like that with like Google Sheets. I don't like you know I'd have to I don't I wouldn't want to do a Google form or anything so I'd have to write my own submission page that would go into the sheet and then regenerate like
11:11:24 on a page. So, so this is already pretty robust like, you know, one way. The challenge of 3d another page with the challenge of like a 2d map, and another page or the challenge of submissions.
11:11:36 So it's kind of a lot me highlight this.
11:11:41 And then all this, there's a bunch of other stuff that like different ideas that I had about, like, different ways to raise awareness like the face filters and tick tock videos are different ways to express my feelings like a music video or when it hundred
11:11:54 phone line where I feel like I could really, I really like acting. So I would quite enjoy acting is either one 800 phone line from a different era, or making music video.
11:12:08 I wonder if you can watch it, can you watch Instagram stories on the browser.
11:12:14 I don't think so yeah let me show I don't know for sure, but I think so, because it's relevant.
11:12:26 Gonna play this down.
11:14:16 I got, like, 50% yes and the present value.
11:14:36 So yeah I posted this like funny series of videos because I was really inspired by that Keegan and Sarah song.
11:14:47 Okay. Um, so, that could also be part of this project.
11:14:53 Yeah.
11:14:54 What did you think of that was pretty entertaining.
11:15:00 It definitely opens a possibility for other people to submit their own.
11:15:05 And what I what I find interesting about it is that you're like opening up multiple modalities for like coping with this and and remembering it like it's not just one, it's not just like telling a story of the time you bought a thing that was important
11:15:20 to you or you know whatever your story might be which is still meaningful.
11:15:25 But this, I like this performative coping that you're doing also
11:15:32 though Yeah, I enjoyed that.
11:15:38 for the, the 2d map of the store to you.
11:15:43 Do you have it Are you going to draw it from memory.
11:15:47 Yeah, that's the challenge I don't I'm probably going to. I've already started drawing it from memory in the sonar app using exclusively emojis.
11:16:00 Find it.
11:16:17 Okay can find it right now but basically it looks like
11:16:22 this, where it's just a map and people, users can walk around.
11:16:28 And it's all constructed with emojis.
11:16:33 And yeah so far I don't have a floor plan of it but I actually don't think it would be that difficult to find because there is a
11:16:46 Facebook group of ex employees that I met a lot of them. I've actually found a lot of really good interesting information about specific to the Burbank store.
11:16:59 I posted about, like, my art project motivations.
11:17:06 And, yeah, I learned that I learned what the store used to be before it was is there some pictures of it from the 50s and 60s and stuff. So, you know, it can be.
11:17:17 I do like I do appreciate how you're saying that there's different ways of coping with this and I think that a lot of time when people are coping, or grieving like they don't know the right way to do it and it kind of spills out and a lot of different
11:17:30 ways.
11:17:33 For sure.
11:17:41 I'm here.
11:17:42 I'm already getting friend requests for me.
11:17:51 Yeah, this is really funny.
11:17:53 Yeah, like people were incentivized kind of knock on each other and the Russian teams were given more money to expose thieving employees, and then I wrote, it's really ironic to read about the stories given the fries employed a vice president who went
11:18:13 to prison for six years for embezzling and the way it was kind of found out was because he was known as the biggest loser in Las Vegas casino history.
11:18:24 Like, it's just really really mind boggling. But anyway, yeah.
11:18:29 And this is not the most relevant part.
11:18:40 Um, yeah so I mean I feel like having the, the base, media, medium as the website, makes a lot of sense and it gives me a framework to work within.
11:18:46 I'm not very good at timelines.
11:18:49 So, like, you know, I already have like a very basic website for week four but it's kind of embarrassing so my plan is to just make it better. week five is actually like make this 3d assets, it's put them on the website make it better.
11:19:05 And this this was this was written, kind of, before thinking about different parts of the website so I might have to revise this in a way that would be would include those things.
11:19:17 So like, probably the discord doesn't even matter so much.
11:19:23 The videos don't really matter so much. It's really about the website.
11:19:32 But I, I've been looking, I've been asking some of my classmates in this in the capstone to show their timelines with me as well because I feel like it's helpful for me to figure out how to like copy other people's those two because I also like given
11:19:50 my ADHD I do have challenges with just like accountability and being able to plan things in a way that is actually doable.
11:20:01 So, it's a bit of a challenge for me.
11:20:05 Just to kind of pop through these slides.
11:20:13 Yeah, a big question that I asked yesterday in my meeting with Kai Sri and Amy was about aesthetic direction and I feel like, probably the best way to go is kind of like a brutalist
11:20:34 fearless internet direction which is already kind of like my own personal aesthetic.
11:20:41 So, obviously I have like some serious here but really, you know, this is kind of a vibe for me.
11:20:48 Right. Mix a lot of sense for something like this. And then, of course, I don't know, I was just kind of dissatisfied with the way this page was looking because it looks kind of like a joke.
11:21:00 And it's not very serious and it wouldn't re inspire.
11:21:05 I don't you know it doesn't communicate as effectively and clearly as I'd like to communicate about a lot of these passions and feelings. So,
11:21:15 yeah,
11:21:19 yeah okay these are these are pretty empty right now, but it's mostly because I'm working in GitHub and I was actually wondering, why did you ask specifically for Google Docs your PDFs, other proposals.
11:21:36 Just because it's easier to walk other people through a PDF.
11:21:40 It doesn't need to be made on Google tech but if you would prefer to do it on GitHub, that's fine, as long as you know, just to, I guess, sorry, a little scattered.
11:21:54 Just I was just trying to give like a closed enough framework to minimize the stress on people trying to figure out what the best way to do it was. So, just sometimes found if you give restrictions then people don't have to worry about like Oh, do I have
11:22:14 to make a video. But if you want to do something different, it's totally fine.
11:22:18 Okay. My Mother Angelica, because I am enjoying how that's the place that I'm using for both the website and both the capstone repo and I don't know, it feels also very like computer to me.
11:22:44 Right. So it seems like an appropriate place to be working in and I've been learning, quite a bit about get. And, like the command line because of this because I think that if I'm managing so many files and thinking so often that it's a lot easier to actually just work on local files and then
11:22:54 push it to the internet.
11:22:58 Yeah.
11:23:02 I mean you could really elegantly make like folders for each one of the sections, with the readme at it for like the main thing and then link between them if you want it, so if you wanted like references I can imagine a folder with the read me that talks
11:23:16 about them and then just a pile of images.
11:23:20 Right. There's a lot of ways, they get could make it easy to organize.
11:23:26 Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
11:23:29 Like that.
11:23:48 Yeah, look at that.
11:23:42 Timeline looks good. Maybe for the the first make this basic website. I don't know if you want to start by doing like a design pass like just doing it and sigma Photoshop or, you know, whatever, or if you would rather just start coding and then style
11:23:57 it from there.
11:24:01 But what you could do is separate those steps, because it might be like, one is worrying about the aesthetic and the other is worried about the content.
11:24:22 It doesn't really matter which order those happening but sometimes I find it helps to break it apart in my brain. And then I guess the map. If you have an idea in here of how you're going to represent the map that might like sit alongside the 3d as like
11:24:33 another large asset to make
11:24:37 you have good ideas for references that I might want to poke around for specifically web web design about projects that are kind of, I really liked Amy's references and I of course I don't overcomplicate things for myself again but I was thinking about.
11:25:00 I always think about the importance of accessibility.
11:25:03 Just UX in general and mobile, because when you're designing a website you're very often designing a website it's being accessed on the phone. So really you're designing two websites, and I saw this really cool thing today.
11:25:16 Okay.
11:25:20 I'm just gonna work. No.
11:25:24 Come on.
11:25:36 No, I'm.
11:25:38 There's too much glare.
11:25:40 We let me just send it to my computer.
11:25:54 So sweet fans website has this really beautiful accessibility pop out.
11:25:59 And it gives you all these features which I thought was just I don't know I saw that and I was like, what now I want every single day and make down this pop out business yeah that's really nice.
11:26:09 But yeah, I also recognize that it's another layer of work.
11:26:16 I guess it could just be a reference somehow because there's something also really interesting about how these sorts of accessibility tools seem to bring us.
11:26:25 At least bring me back atmospherically to the type of internet and the type of, like, technological culture that felt really comfortable and simple.
11:26:39 All right yeah when I actually first started making accessible sites. One of the ways to do it was to use the links the terminal browser, like a text on the terminal browser, because it was really expensive to buy screen readers.
11:26:52 And so, for like a person who didn't need one. It was one of the only ways to get that version of the site. So, I also have fond memories of browsing sites on links.
11:27:05 See what they really feel like.
11:27:08 So it's really about having a
11:27:12 very well organized like data structure.
11:27:16 Yeah, so you can think of like if you can only move through a keyboard. Do you want to have to go through all of the navigation items per should you be able to skip that to see, to get to like the main content.
11:27:28 And then, when I go to images to they describe themselves but of course now it's like more layered because there's contrast ratios and screen readers are way more sophisticated than they were back in the day.
11:27:42 Yeah. No, it's interesting thinking about the way that these technologies have developed because one thing that's been really helpful for me to think about in terms of this project and the timeline is to actually just finish something on day one, you
11:27:59 know, have something like this for example today already have a website.
11:28:05 And what I do on day two and day three day four is just improve it and, like, make it better and but it's always presentable. So I can just be you know making like archive.
11:28:14 org screenshots of my work process already which is funny like using a memorial internet like archiving tools to document your own work process is pretty funny.
11:28:27 Yeah.
11:28:29 But I, yeah.
11:28:33 Like, do screen readers today are they working on top of that sort of system that you were working on in the past or is it just totally different.
11:28:42 It's still layered on top of it a bit but in the, in the meantime, they've added a lot of new things, Visa, it's like a called the ARIA label or Aria level.
11:28:52 So you can add these extra attributes to elements on the page to like tell a screen reader that it's important that it's a big area.
11:29:03 And actually, one exercise, it's really good is to turn on voiceover if you're on a Mac, and then go into Safari and try to get used to the tools there.
11:29:15 So you can hit like. It's Command Option you and it brings up this map of the whole page that you can go through with your keyboard.
11:29:24 And you can really start to get a sense of this, I don't know this alternate structure of have a web page,
11:29:34 going through it a lot now I redo the DNA website, tried to make it workable.
11:29:40 That's cool. I never really understood how a lot of the accessibility settings in Mac iOS are used. I've toggled on like.
11:29:53 I think there's a way to control the mouse with your head movements, dude.
11:29:59 Yeah, I don't know if that's used very much at all.
11:30:04 Yeah. I don't know about that either.
11:30:09 And I guess, with the facial expression like sticking your tongue out.
11:30:13 Right.
11:30:14 It's really crazy if you've tried it, it's really funny like to show people like look ma no hands.
11:30:19 Right.
11:30:22 Yeah, I would be curious to know how many people use it.
11:30:26 I mean I guess if it's even if it's just a few it's worth it, but I'm sure they're mining it for all sorts of machine vision data, but
11:30:38 still interesting.
11:30:41 I like the idea of having like a base that you iterate on and improve rather than like pushing towards some final thing to reveal at the end.
11:30:51 I think that's a good way of working, and a good way of, like, when we talk for me to like, you know you can see concrete changes in progress so it's really helpful.
11:31:06 There's already a
11:31:11 archives.
11:31:12 History. There's only two updates so far I think two captures, and one just has, you know, one has a bit more information on the other.
11:31:23 Right.
11:31:27 Yes, but I think having this will be, so be super helpful.
11:31:34 Oh, about the collecting people's stories.
11:31:42 I'm feeling I saw some, like they're non Google data collection things you don't get a lot of control over what the form looks like.
11:31:52 But it might be able to throw one together.
11:31:57 Something that I actually use a lot is air table, probably mostly just, it's not Google, but it actually make allows you to make slightly better looking forms that dumps the data into a database that you can visually, it looks like a spreadsheet.
11:32:16 And then there's an easy API to pull those out.
11:32:21 But also, honestly, it, It's not so much
11:32:27 to build a PHP script that like saves the information to a database somewhere.
11:32:36 So that's something that if you run into issues with other other solutions we could throw together for you.
11:32:46 Okay. Um, yeah I'd have to think about the database.
11:32:56 Like a more permanent one I mean,
11:33:00 could I throw it onto my like UCLA cloud, actually.
11:33:07 Yeah, all that would be supported on part of the DMA servers for sure. Did you told me that I'd have my, my own you know like Tilda Anastasio storage there forever which seems you know I don't want to abuse it obviously.
11:33:26 I mean nobody else uses it.
11:33:29 That's why it's so great, it's so few people use it, that it's there, you know, and Ellen is pretty militant about making sure that that's always available, which is great.
11:33:40 Cool. Cool. Yeah, sweet Why are we using Google drive's,
11:33:47 I guess well, UCLA decided to sell us to Google a few years back here.
11:33:53 I mean where you could get arts were sold to Microsoft, which is funny.
11:33:58 Like the School of Art, the art stuff at ucla. edu emails or on Microsoft servers. So, the reason
11:34:11 that Microsoft probably feels a little bit more evil to me than to you.
11:34:15 Do you have a emotional reaction to or bit.
11:34:21 No, I don't.
11:34:22 Okay.
11:34:27 And considering if I want to work there and not because I know that there is there like mixed feelings about it. I don't know.
11:34:35 Just thinking about it anyway.
11:34:36 But it was worth asking.
11:34:38 Yeah.
11:34:42 I think you're in a good place. It feels it feels much more focused than last week and, but without sacrificing anything, which I think is is well done like you've taken all these elements and started to find a way to bring them together so well done
11:34:59 on that
11:35:01 did want to send this to which depending on which direction you go with the 3d model of the UFO may be more straightforward than like a full three. js view if you just want to toss a 3d model and a page.
11:35:19 This is an easy way to do it.
11:35:24 Makes it behave a little bit more like a active image area kind of thing.
11:35:32 Is it pretty customizable like, I don't, I don't think I want to it to be interactive actually with the mouse I wanted to just be there, maybe. Yeah, I think you can turn all that off.
11:35:53 There are two events.
11:36:03 I'll have to dig through it I think you can turn it off. What is a.gl B. It's one of the Silicon Valley's infinite desire to make new file formats.
11:36:24 Get combines a texture map with a 3d model. That's what it does.
11:36:20 Cool.
11:36:21 I want to make a new file format to go for it, we obviously need more, apparently.
11:36:34 Yes, something that's basically like a file format for, like, a tick tock style file.
11:36:41 Okay, so it's like, I guess it would be looping video with a text inside of it as well.
11:36:51 text or something.
11:36:55 But
11:36:55 because I think those files are really important I don't understand why we need to only share them on something like ticked off.
11:37:01 Right. You know, like a video mean, I guess, means should be a file format of their own actually.
11:37:09 Yeah, not just file formats man, that's, that's really the driver.
11:37:15 Right.
11:37:18 That reminds me a little bit of exact classes here technologies project.
11:37:27 Thinking of like queer protocols like very low level. Computer Interaction methodologies and then querying them.
11:37:36 That was that was his thesis work at DNA.
11:37:41 That's cool. Do you know I'm Zach Blass was ever friends with Jeffrey scatter.
11:37:48 It seems likely just because of when they were around them around the same time. Yeah, not at that I Jeffrey was before.
11:37:59 I don't know if Jeffrey ever went to does my maybe he just taught.
11:38:02 Yeah that's it i mean he was like, that's my Jason at some point but I don't remember when that was
11:38:16 internet
11:38:27 now looks like he was there, after, after Zach is just It looks like he was just teaching at DMA 2016 and Zach was like.
11:38:40 nine.
11:38:42 Nine.
11:38:44 Well, yeah, it was Jeffrey who inspired me to even start thinking about alternate file formats and creating file formats.
11:38:54 Yeah, as like a internet infrastructure building practice that doesn't have anything to do with working at a specific company or producing like a single type of object or a static or whatever.
11:39:07 Yeah.
11:39:12 Okay, well, I feel, I feel like, you know, if you think that I'm, you know, moving in a good direction and Okay then. I feel good about it too. And, yeah, Okay.
11:39:27 Yeah, I definitely do, and I think
11:39:33 you start to feel like, I don't know, lost or overwhelmed or whatever we can.
11:39:40 There's many ways to kind of reorient and refocus things as you like collect the content and put them together on the site I think it'll, it's just going to start shaping itself.
11:39:53 And then hopefully there's room in there to get in some of the core ideas you had about, OK.
11:40:10 Yeah, and you end up in a project. Do you think I should still be working under the like save fries name.
11:40:18 Yeah, I think what I find interesting about it is how that can become a specific place to open up.
11:40:27 memories of these histories that we thought would happen.
11:40:30 Whereas if you just dive right in. into it, like there's something about the like first response that is that it's kind of a joke and it's kind of funny that I think opens people up to this next layer of connection, as opposed to just like diving into
11:40:48 a critique of that loss, where your audience is going to shrink quite a bit.
11:40:57 Right.
11:40:57 Um, yeah I'm, I was, I guess I was thinking about that question also because
11:41:03 I'm a little bit concerned that.
11:41:07 So, right now, let me show you the fries website is. It was like initially actually created by my boyfriend Ben, obviously because I talked about this stuff all the time and he was like, wouldn't it be funny if I just like bought the URL that you're talking
11:41:21 about, and I'm actually made the website. So he did make the, the initial first website. And then I made the second update. But like on his device, because I was just like, I don't, I don't know how to like immediately move it to mine.
11:41:38 So, I'm only recently did he even transfer the repo to me and then he'll be transferring like the server, the AWS credentials over to my AWS, which is I guess we're all have six that's right so my stuff right now.
11:41:50 But I am wondering a little bit just about, you know, this is like me presenting my work, and it was started by me. It is a passion of mine like it's clear that this is my work but I am also a little bit concerned about having other people involved in
11:42:07 it at any point and, like, I've talked to Ben about it and he doesn't have, like, claim any authorship over it and I obviously like I want to keep the.
11:42:16 I don't want to like right over.
11:42:19 Commit history and pretend as if I did things that I didn't because I think that being transparent about who does what and who contributes how much is important.
11:42:29 But that's also one of the reasons I was thinking like, oh, maybe I should move away from this. Save phrase calm thing that kind of just happened as a joke and then it, I took it really seriously and I took it, you know, do a completely different level.
11:42:44 Oh, I don't know, I think it's okay, but I just wanted to ask what you think.
11:42:50 Yeah, I think it's fine.
11:42:52 I mean, like you said it was your idea and there might be some extent to which get hub or get implies like a different history or like questions the authenticity but authenticity is overrated.
11:43:12 Anyway, and it's not like it's unusual for someone to have an idea, and then someone else to do the first like technical implementation of it, right. So, you know, it could be, who would be the same if you hired him to start building it right right don't
11:43:36 show up as his, etc.
11:43:36 But you know, at the same time like it's easy to be first it's harder to be better, so right you just like let's do that first version.
11:43:44 It's kind of boring but like the way that you're taking it what's going to really bring the heart to the project.
11:43:52 Okay, cool.
11:43:54 Um, yeah I just wanted to clarify that because I know that I don't know I like I remember having a couple experiences in like Casey's classes where someone worked with other people's work and even if it was credited there's still questions about authorship
11:44:08 and stuff. And I just wanted to be really transparent about the process here.
