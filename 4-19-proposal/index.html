        1-3 paragraphs, describe your project in detail, using as simple and direct language. Avoid jargon.
What are your main questions/influences? What ideas ground your research? What form does the project take? Why is the work urgent, necessary, relevant today? Who is the ideal audience / what community is the project most accountable to?

        <blockquote>The anonymity (the internet) provides has revealed some of the most evil parts of humanity, from the dark alt-right recesses of Reddit to the vicious death threats floating around sites like Twitter and YouTube.</blockquote>
        <p>
          I <em>really</em> want to stress that Reddit is not very different from Facebook, Twitter, or Youtube in terms of hosting controversial content, and also that far from all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversial_Reddit_communities">controversial banned subreddits</a> were associated with the alt right. Associating Reddit with a fraction of its userbase discounts the work of thousands of communities that have helped people with their career, personal finance, mental health, physical lifestyle and more. It scares new users away from the website and dooms the platforms future to not having people who would otherwise be interested in promoting more helpful and interesting communities. <br>
I'll also mention that I believe it's very important to think about our definition of the alt right and who it applies to. The new right in general is a huge community comprised of many smaller groups. Many people in this community don't identify with the alt right, and many of those who do disavow people that would be typically categorized as such by those outside of the group, for example Milo Yiannopolous. Even that name is incredibly irrelevant in 2021, when the Capitol gets stormed by a crowd wearing MAGA garb. When it comes to political communities, accuracy is incredibly important in order to interface with them at all.
          <br>
          Regarding to the comment about the "most evil parts of humanity", I believe that death threats on mainstream social media and forums for USA conservatives pale in comparison with the Uyghur genocide in China that has also been revealed to many primarily via the internet, or how Muammar Gaddafi's executed corpse was dragged behind a tractor, televised on Facebook Live by Arab Spring protestors in a horrific act of justice. The "alt right" is a group of disgruntled US citizens that weren't happy with their government, and then got exploited by a megalomaniac presidential candidate funded by truly evil super PACS like Mercer, who funded last week's Capitol Hill protest which led to riots. Placing blame on the populace as "evil" absolves the bigger players and master-manipulators of guilt.

      <blockquote>In the “How to Internet” reading, I think it’s interesting how she mentions that most people no longer need a “how to internet” guide anymore, but actually use the internet to learn how to do every other thing they don’t already know.</blockquote>
  <p>I really wish that we still had "how to internet" guides, or even a whole educational institution for it!</p>
