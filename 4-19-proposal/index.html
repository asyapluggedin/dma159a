    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        SaveFrys.com is a memorial website for the now shut down big box electronics retailer Fry's Electronics.
        <br><br>
        I have been interested in the memento mori concept for a while. In a way,  I think that most of my work is "about" death in one way or another:
        <ul>
    <li>My name, Anastasia, means "resurrection", a concept which is one of the more traumatic responses to death</li>
    <li>I feel incredibly defined creatively by my ADHD, which I believe was amplified by my mother's early death (I was only 2)</li>
    <li>As a "bicultural" person (rather than immigrant), I always feel like I am mourning something from my "other" homeland whenever I am not present. All my favorite childhood environments are gone forever, and worse, the micro-cultures I've grown through are also constantly transforming and fading. As I move around various friendships and communities, industries and creative directions, every time I'm obsessed with something new I'm secretly mourning a huge loss.</li></ul>
    My own Fry's story is surprisingly, not about childhood memories of my parents losing me in the vast aisles of the store. The first time I visited Fry's Electronics, I was 19, and learning how to fix and build computers. A friend of mine that I was learning from was excited to show me the store as I'd never heard of it before, so we drove to Burbank, store #11. The experience was mind-twisting. I still remember that day, what the sky looked like, what we bought (I still own the monitor I got that day – and the box, in case I'd ever want to return it), even the store layout that has since been rearranged several times. 
    <br>Five years later I wanted to become that kind of teacher myself: so I made my little brother a fake gift card (Since you can't program a real gift card to be in the dollar amount equivalent to his YouTube subscriber count). He wanted to build his own computer for gaming, and I thought a trip to Store #11 would be the perfect Christmas gift for a 12 year old.

    When we finally made it to the store, felt the smell of it's imminent demise. Surely, two weeks later, the sudden announcement came: Fry's Electronics is shutting down. After some collective mourning and grieving, I started thinking about how weird it is that the fun and excitement of shopping for electronics isn't present in e-commerce. Even with TikTok and Discord, it's just not the same. I decided to make a Discord server myself – to transform my grief into passion and energy to build something new and beautiful. <br>
    I was thinking about community shopping experiences on social platform: there are already a lot of cool Discord servers for buying electronics, like buildapc and StockDrops, so why not add one where I could recreate all the zany things I love about Fry's?

        <figcaption>I'm really interested in making some sort of large scale image that could either be printed on stretched canvas, lenticular print, or projected onto the building after the UFO is demolished.</figcaption>

    <h2>Questions and Concerns</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is a single website going to feel like "enough" or satisfying for this project?</li>
            <li>What is the purpose of the actual objects I have bought?</li>
            <li>What's an appropriate way to include my proclivity to performance in this?</li>
            <li>Is using three.js going to be so annoying I fail?</li>
            <li>Is Brutalist web design a good direction to take this project? I want it to look polished but also celebrates Web 1.0 aesthetics. </li>
            <li>When building out the interactive memory-share part, is it OK to scrape my discord and the Fry's Employees FB group for submissions?</li>
            <li>How much does drone video cost? Is it illegal to take HD video of the UFO?</li>
            <li>Will I be able to do this in time before it's demolished?</li>
        </ul>
