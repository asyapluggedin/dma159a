# Writing Meditation 2 - CONCEPT DIAGRAM
### DUE MONDAY 4/12
        This is a two-pat exercise. Finish part one BEFORE reading part 2.
        
        Part I
        Draw a diagram of your idea. Place the main theme of your project at the center. Visually arrange other keywords/themes around it. Don’t hold back, include any idea, theme, question that factors into your project, place ones you’re unsure of at the margins. If you feel like there isn't a single main theme, draw a cluster of the main ideas and build from there.

* Should I make a website, or should I make a physical piece?
