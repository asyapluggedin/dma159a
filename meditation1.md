# Writing Meditation 1 - INQUIRY
### DUE MONDAY 4/5
        List as many questions as you can about the project you are attempting. 
        Do not compose answers at the moment, simply list the questions that emerge.

        Abstract or Concrete? 
        Large or small? What materials can I use? 
        What will be the overall look and feel? 
        What are my ‘points of view’ toward the subject matter? Who has dealt with this problem before?
       

* Should I make a website, or should I make a physical piece?
* Can I actually get the UFO?
* Is it OK to make my mission to save the UFO also my senior project?
* Will anybody from Fry's Electronics actually percieve my motivation to create a memorial as credible rather than crazy?
* Do I have any credibility as an artist?
* Do I want to have credibility as an artist?
* Where will I install that UFO if I get to install it? Bakersfield, where it's easy, or a museum, which would take work but be more useful to society at large?
* What does installing it in the ground mean versus having it in the side of the big box store?
* Did taking the sunset foot clinic sign down, and then putting it in the store – did that act commemorate it in a way that was appropriate for Los Angeles culture, or did it happen in a way that was more like some guy just wanting to sign for his own reasons that aren't very charitable. 
* Should the foot clinic sign continue to rotate? 
* Should the UFO continue to be in a horizontal position rather than a vertical one?

* If I decided to make a website, how long will that process take?
* Do I need to configure storage? Is that too annoying? 
* Why am I even using GitHub for my assignments?
* Would I have to make a 3D render? 
* Would it be productive to force myself to get good at 3D even though I totally failed that throughout all of DMA lmao?
* Could I visit Sarah Drake during her office hours and learn Blender?
* Would learning Blender for a 10 week project be cathartic bc I never felt satisfied with my 3D skills at DMA?
* Would learning Blender be satisfying as it creates a nice full circle with [this interview I did with John Michael Boling](http://dismagazine.com/dystopia/84329/culturesport-tv-interview-john-michael-boling-3/) before I even started DMA or even working at [Are.na](Are.na)?

* What is my motivation with the Adbusters type of branding and UI kind of hacking work?
* Have I already exhausted and explored all these questions with Jeffrey and my student work group?
* Maybe it's okay that I didn't get this assignment on time?
* What do I want my senior capstone project to represent?
* Is it okay to put so much pressure on myself and ask this project to represent four years of work at DMA and my whole design experience?
* Can a single work represent everything that an artist has worked towards?
* Someone once told me *__"A photographer is only as good as their last photograph."__* Is that a horrible thing to think?
* How do I reconcile all of my inspirations and references in one place? Is that even possible?
* Should I put the goal of learning something in this experience or should I just let the learning happen naturally?
* How do I get performance and mixed reality, and my real life, live talent embodied in this work?
* If I just make a website or a sculpture, will people see my personality?
* Is my personality even relevant to experience my work?
* Do I want to move past using my personality as a crutch for my work?
* Is any of this stuff pedagogical?
* Why did I abandon pedagogy as an art practice?
* Did I abandon pedagogy or did I just abandon the idea of a pedagogical art practice, and if it's the latter, why did I abandon that?
* How do I make a work intended for an audience, for somebody else, ultimately, work that serves a purpose for other people and lights other people up inside?
* How do I take responsibility for other people and lead with my work? How do I lead as an artist and as a designer responsibly? 
* How do I make sure that my motivations for creating don't have something to do with emotions that are unresolved inside me?
* Should all emotions be resolved? Dhould every artist make things because they are perfectly mentally healthy?
* Why don't I want to make anything about being Russian?
* Is this about being bicultural, is there something about diaspora that also has to do with growing up and longing for the past, for wanting people to "wake up"?
* What is my specific experience of diaspora?
* Why do I shy away from those type of personal narratives, is it because there's no cultural space for Russian diaspora suffering to voice itself?
* Is it because I don't like to be pigeonholed into post Soviet aesthetics? 
* Is it because the post Soviet aesthetic is still really misunderstood?
* Why do I gravitate towards brutalist web design and web 1.0?
* Am I more American than I am Russian?
* Is identifying as an American something very Russian to do?

* Why do I really think that *__"Capitalism is the most engaging form of art"__*?
* When SOFIA RETA told me that, was I learning something new or was it something I had known for a long time resonating with me?
* Is it material capitalism or just capitalism in general?
* Does this have any relationship to my chilidhood that transpired between a post-soviet world and a hypercapitalist world?
* Why did I not develop a strong relationship to the arts in Russia?
* Why did I fall asleep at the Bolshoi Theatre, hate studying Latin and imperial-era plays?
* Why did I skip school to see contemporary art at the Biennale?
* What is the political utility of contemporary art in Russia today?
* Why do all my friends in the net art scene struggle so much to succeed as artists in Russia?
* What does the history of soviet and pre-soviet art truly represent to me?
* Why have I gravitated far more towards utilitarian and populist creativity, like the socialist realism in the Moscow Metro, and the retro-futuristic renderings of a beautiful tomorrow?
* Has creativity always represented community to me?
* What is the relationship I have with creativity, community, and my own ego?
* Am I "over" reconstructing my own ego, finally, as I am 26 years old and in my final term at DMA?
* Is hating capitalism American?
* Is loving capitalism Russian?
* Why do I struggle with leadership so much yet feel so drawn to it? 
* Why do other people see me as a "leader" or an "artist" while I shy away from those labels?

* Is it actually a good idea to use UX and UI as a medium for a capstone project?
* Is it actually a good idea to use CPG branding as a medium for a capstone project?
* Who cares, if it matters to me?
* Can I tell the Fry's story via AdBusters type of hacking product packaging?
* How can people publicly mourn without sacrificing their sense of privacy and their personal boundaries?
* Can I help the Fry's brothers grieve?
* Can my project potentially help capitalist crowds - like disenfranchised workers, betrayed customers – and capitalist leaders, like the Fry's brothers – can my project help these two antagonistic entities see one another as people?
* Do I sound like Kendal Jenner offering a coke for "peace"?
* How do I reconcile my feelings of empathy towards the Fry's brothers, their loss of their father, and the responsibility they had as leaders?
* Can I be empathetic towards capitalists while trying to "solve" the problems of capitalism?
* Can I create an artwork that communicates elegantly what the problem is, without creating figurehead "bad guys"?
* How much space can I make in my work for other people's needs?
* Does listening to people's needs during the process ruin the work and the final product, rendering it useless and unable to serve anybody's needs?
* Why Fry's Electronics and not places my dad took me? Why do I not have such a strong emotional connection to the Raddison Blu's fishtank, theme parks in Sacramento and Gilroy Gardens, Golden Gate park, Novinsky Passazh, Gorbushkin Dvor, even Starlite Diner?
* Am I betraying something in myself?
* Does my pull towards my US or Russian side , does it pull me away from the other side?
* Do I need a drone to scan the entire UFO and get all its crevices and cracks?
* Will a museum or arts foundation care if I fail to preserve the original piece and end up making a replica?
* Will people who care about Fry's care?
* What's the deal with trademark infringement?
* How do I ensure none of my work hurts people, and I communicate every step of the way with empathy and grace?
* How do I ensure my anger doesn't get to the best of me in a stressful capstone environment?
* Who is here for me, and how do I best respect them?
