# Writing Meditation 1 - INQUIRY
 ## DUE MONDAY 4/5
        List as many questions as you can about the project you are attempting. 
        Do not compose answers at the moment, simply list the questions that emerge.

        Abstract or Concrete? 
        Large or small? What materials can I use? 
        What will be the overall look and feel? 
        What are my ‘points of view’ toward the subject matter? Who has dealt with this problem before?
